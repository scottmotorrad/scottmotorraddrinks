I finally got a chance to try the Old Fitz 19 at Moonshine and I'm very glad I did.

## Old Fitzgerald 19 Fall 2022

**Age**: 19 years

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: Right away it is super oaky with an almost menthol quality on the palate. There is also some subtle sweetness and baking spice. The finish was long and surprisingly spicy. 


**2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** V good but I'll take the 17 and FOMO cured
