Caribou Crossing is credited as being the first Canadian Single barrel and has also been described as the bottle from Rock Hill Farms with the [Blanton's](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/04/16/Review-107-Blanton-s-Single-Barrel/) topper or simply as Canadian Blanton's. I finally snagged a bottle to see if it loved up to the hype!

## Caribou Crossing
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $47.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Astringent nose with predominantly maple and ethanol notes. 

**Taste**: Maple syrup, floral and oak notes with a better mouthfeel than I was expecting for an 80 proofer.

**Finish**: Medium length with a touch of warm spice then oak notes.

## Conclusion
This one did not do it for me. It had those distinct ethanol and maple notes I get from most Canadian whiskies and did not remind me of Blanton's at all. That said this was better than most Canadian's I've had so if you like that style of whiskies this might be for you but it's not for me. On the plus side I can cross another hard to find bottle off my hunting list and I was able to finish my pour with a little Coke Zero :)

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
