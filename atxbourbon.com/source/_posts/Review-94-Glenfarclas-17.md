This is the second in a 3 part series tasting my way up the Glenfarclas lineup with the 12 year, 17 year and 21 year.

## Glenfarclas 17
**Age**: 17 years

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A light, pale gold 

**Cask Type**: 100% Oloroso sherry casks

**Price**: $104.99

### Neat
**Nose**:  Gentle and sweet nose with honey, dark fruit, malt and oak notes

**Taste**: More of the same notes from the notes with strong sherry notes and a surprisingly viscous mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with sweet honey and oak fading to warm spice notes.

## Conclusion
This is another great whiskey from Glenfarclas with strong sherry notes and softer edges than [the 12 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/16/Review-92-Glenfarclas-12/).  The oak notes are more developed throughout bringing in another dimension and bringing it up a notch. Glenfiddich takes the belt back at this price range though the [outstanding Glenfiddich 18](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/20/Review-43-Glenfiddich-18/). All in all another great sherried single malt from Glenfarclas.
