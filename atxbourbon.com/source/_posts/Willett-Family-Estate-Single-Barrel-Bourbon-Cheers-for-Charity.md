Picking up where I left off with the Bob's Cipher pick next up for Willett is the Bourbon Charity "Cheers for Charity" Single Barrel. This barrel is Willett's [High Corn Mashbill](http://bourbonr.com/blog/willett-distillery-mash-bill-breakdown/) and was sold to raise money for Kids for Kids

## Willett Family Estate Cheers for Charity

**Age**: 8 year

**Proof**: 119.2

**Barrel No**: 2129

### Neat

**Nose**: Sweet caramel, vanilla cream, bright fruit, hints of spice and oak.

**Taste**: Perfectly balanced between sweet, spice and oak with more of the fruit from the nose, baking spice, less caramel and vanilla but still some and enough oak to let you know it had been in barrel. Pleasant but not overly viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long and warm with a bit of sweet fruit then lingering barrel char and baking spice.

## Conclusion

For single digit aged bourbons this is one of the best I've had. It drinks a little below the 119 proof but packs a ton of flavor. The notes aren't anything crazy but the balance and progression of them really worked for me. I also enjoy how present the core bourbon flavors were throughout.

If I had to nitpick on why not a perfect 4 stars I would have preferred more viscosity and a more interesting finish. That said this was an amazing bottle and even better since it was to support a great cause.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

**TL;DR:** Fantastic bottle, great cause
