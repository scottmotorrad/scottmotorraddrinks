## Data
Picked this up from [Oak Liquor Cabinet](http://oakliquorcabinet.com/) a few weeks ago and just got around to having my second glass. The case it came in was cool but I just threw it out so nothing to write home about. They include these little cards with tasting notes and a break down of which floors of which warehouse the whiskey came from. I'm not sure that is information I care about but whatever.

**Abv**: 127 proof (63.7% ABV)

**Age**: 6 years 3 months 14 days

## Review

**Color**: A deep, rich amber

### Neat

**Nose**: Honey and hints of spice

**Taste**: The honey from the nose transitions into a richer, sweet caramel. Surisingly little heat despite the proof

**Finish**: Long sweet caramel finish with just a touch of spice at the end

### On a rock

**Nose**: On ice the sweet nose is preserved and almost reminds me of a dessert wine

**Taste**: A delicious explosion of caramel and butterscotch. Very tasty indeed.

**Finish**: Unfortunately shortened by the ice and mostly just a touch of spice

## Conclusion 
An excellent bourbon though I wish the spice was a little more prevalent and that the finish stood up to ice a bit better(it's hot here). I was also a bit disappointed not to catch the cherry notes the card that came with it mentioned. I probably won't pick up another bottle of Kathleen's batch but I will be keeping my eye out for another bottle from another batch. I do like high abv sweet bourbons :)
