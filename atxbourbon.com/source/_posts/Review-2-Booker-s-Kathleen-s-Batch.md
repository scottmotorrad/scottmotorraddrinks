## Data
Picked this up from [Oak Liquor Cabinet](http://oakliquorcabinet.com/) a few weeks ago and just got around to having my second glass. The case it came in was cool but I just threw it out so nothing to write home about. They include these little cards with tasting notes and a break down of which floors of which warehouse the whiskey came from. I'm not sure that is information I care about but whatever.

**Abv**: 127 proof (63.7% ABV)

**Age**: 6 years 3 months 14 days

## Review

**Color**: A deep, rich amber

### Neat

**Nose**: Honey and hints of spice

**Taste**: The honey from the nose transitions into a richer, sweet caramel. Surisingly little heat despite the proof

**Finish**: Long sweet caramel finish with just a touch of spice at the end

### On a rock

**Nose**: On ice the sweet nose is preserved and almost reminds me of a dessert wine

**Taste**: A delicious explosion of caramel and butterscotch. Very tasty indeed.

**Finish**: Unfortunately shortened by the ice and mostly just a touch of spice

## Conclusion 
An excellent bourbon though I wish the spice was a little more prevalent and that the finish stood up to ice a bit better(it's hot here). I was also a bit disappointed not to catch the cherry notes the card that came with it mentioned. I probably won't pick up another bottle of Kathleen's batch but I will be keeping my eye out for another bottle from another batch. I do like high abv sweet bourbons :)

8/10 - One of my favorites and always on my whiskey shelf

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
