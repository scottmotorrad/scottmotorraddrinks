Beast Masters Club released a series of 3 Elijah Craig picks this year "Smell", "The" and "Beaver" and while I didn't need that many EC picks I did decide to pickup Beaver.

## Elijah Craig Beast Masters Club 'Beaver'

**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 94 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Sharp vanilla and oak notes with sweet caramel underneath.

**Taste**: More caramel and rich oak with vanilla extract and faint spice. Nice mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with vanilla cream and a building spice.


## Conclusion
 Overall this was on par with most Elijah Craig picks I've had. It was heavy on the vanilla but I enjoyed it. I usually think EC picks are a great value but with Beast Masters Club's New York prices and shipping I would have gladly settled for a local pick.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** About what you would expect from an EC pick.
