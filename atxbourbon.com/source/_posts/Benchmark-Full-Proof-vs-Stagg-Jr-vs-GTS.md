I was chatting with a friend who referred to Benchmark Full Proof as Stagg Jr Jr claiming he had heard it was pretty close to Stagg Jr. Between that and my [own experience with EHT Single Barrel vs Benchmark Bonded](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CdbTF_HgowM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) I was intrigued.

The blind tasting video is on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cmf8bS4qQBB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jVsl17sYWZ8) if you want to watch it; alternatively read below for the results and tasting notes. Also, I apparently forgot to write a review of 2020 GTS so this will have to count as that too.

### Benchmark Full Proof

**Age**: NAS (probably barely 4 years)

**Proof**: 125

**Place**: Distant 3rd

**Notes**: The nose brings ethanol with a bit of spiced cherry pie. The palate is slightly harsh with ethanol burn, caramel, baking spice and a bit of cherry. The mouthfeel is solid but the proof is not well integrated. The finish is medium length and hot.

**Stars**: **0** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

### Stagg Jr Batch 15

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 131.1

**Place**: Close 2nd

**Notes**: The nose is all cherry and rye spice. The palate brings cherry cola, rich oak, baking spices, caramel and enough proof to let you know it’s there. Great texture and mouthfeel that is thick but not oily.The long finish has notes of lingering spice, oak and faint cherry.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

### George T Stagg 2020

**Age**: 15 years

**Proof**: 130.4

**Place**: 1st!

**Notes**: The nose is like an overly boozy holiday spiced cherry pie. The palate has notes of rich oak, cherry cola, caramel, vanilla cream, baking spice and a bit of brown sugar. The proof integration is excellent, it lets you know it’s a heavyweight without overwhelming. The finish is very long, slightly dry and a little spicy with fading cola and lingering oak and rye spice. 

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

Overall no surprise in the rankings. I was once again surprised by how good Stagg Jr iseven right next to GTS. I will not be drinking anymore Benchmark Full Proof straight but I'm sure it will be fine for cooking and cocktails.
