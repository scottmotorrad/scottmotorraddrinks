This is a NAS cask strength rye from [Sagamore Spirits](https://sagamorespirit.com/spirits/cask-strength-rye-whiskey/?age-verified=fa8426e080). It ironically is loaded with marketing language about Maryland and insists that there are "no shortcuts here" when it is sourced from MGP. I was hoping we were getting away from this sort of thing in the craft spirits scene but alas we are not. Well let's see if the taste makes up for it!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 112.2 proof

**Color**: A reddish copper 

**Price**: $64.99

**Batch** 2e

### Neat
**Nose**: A little hot with cinnamon and baking spice notes

**Taste**: Also a little hot with more herbal notes at the front leading to cinnamon and baking spice with just a hint of something sweeter. Vanilla maybe? Decent mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long and hot with mostly cinnamon notes here as well

## On a rock
**Nose**: Significantly mellowed by the ice bringing the cinnamon way down and bring forward the vanilla and herbal notes from the neat taste.

**Taste**: The ice helps here too by greatly improving the mouthfeel to something nice and viscous, taming the heat and again bringing the vanilla out alongside a bit of honey. The baking spice and herbal notes are still there and slightly subdued.

**Finish**: The honey and vanilla fade back to a shorter cinnamon finish.

## Conclusion
I wouldn't drink this neat and was ready to give it a harsh review but the ice really saved it for me. That said I still won't be looking for a backup bottle but I'd be willing to drink it on the rocks at a bar or at a cookout. It was too pricey for what it is too me and I'd take a nice [Willet 4 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/07/Reviews-70-71-Old-Forester-Rye-Whisky-and-Willet-Family-Estate-4-Year-114-4-Proof/) or [High West Rendezvous Rye](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/23/Review-44-High-West-Rendezvous-Rye/) over it and save a few bucks.

I'd be interested to taste that 2017 batch that won Double Gold at the SF Spirits Competition and their Port Finish though. 

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
