This is the third and final in a 3 part series tasting my way up the Glenfarclas lineup with the 12 year, 17 year and 21 year. This mini series has been a lot of fun and doing more scotch reviews is building my hype for my trip in May! So let's see the last one of these Glenfarclas stacks up.

## Glenfarclas 21
**Age**: 21 years

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $129.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Strong sherry notes of dark fruit are backed by some floral and oak notes. 

**Taste**: Floral and malt notes through out with oak and dark fruit as well, similarly nice mouthfeel to the 17.

**Finish**: Medium length with sweet dark fruit and nuts giving way to warm spice.

## Conclusion
First off another great single malt from Glenfarclas. I wish I had discovered these guys earlier as a nice change up from Balvenie and Glenfiddich. This had more oak than the younger expressions and was less of a sherry bomb.

Overall I preferred the 17 year from these 3, especially given the price difference. I'll be reviewing 2 more 21 year Speyside single malts to see how they compare with the Glenfarclas.

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

[**Great**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/great-value/) - A great deal, I'd buy it again
