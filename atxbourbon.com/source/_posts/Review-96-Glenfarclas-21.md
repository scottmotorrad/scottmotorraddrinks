This is the third and final in a 3 part series tasting my way up the Glenfarclas lineup with the 12 year, 17 year and 21 year. This mini series has been a lot of fun and doing more scotch reviews is building my hype for my trip in May! So let's see the last one of these Glenfarclas stacks up.

## Glenfarclas 21
**Age**: 21 years

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $129.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Strong sherry notes of dark fruit are backed by some floral and oak notes. 

**Taste**: Floral and malt notes through out with oak and dark fruit as well, similarly nice mouthfeel to the 17.

**Finish**: Medium length with sweet dark fruit and nuts giving way to warm spice.

## Conclusion
First off another great single malt from Glenfarclas. I wish I had discovered these guys earlier as a nice change up from Balvenie and Glenfiddich. This had more oak than the younger expressions and was less of a sherry bomb.

Overall I preferred the 17 year from these 3, especially given the price difference. I'll be reviewing 2 more 21 year Speyside single malts to see how they compare with the Glenfarclas.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
