Something like 12 Eagle Rare picks hit Austin last year and I managed to snag most of them. We also did a big Eagle Rare blind bracket with the Austin Dead Liver Society that I've been meaning to write about. In the meantime here is one of the many tasty picks.

## Eagle Rare Tejas Liquors pick 2020

**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Price**: 49.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with cherry and caramel with faint spices.

**Taste**: More cherry, vanilla, baking spice and a sweet note I can't place but that is almost like artificial sweetener. Slightly thin mouthfeel but reasonable for 90 proof

**Finish**: That same sweet note linger with vanilla and the first oak of the dram coming in towards the end of the long finish.


## Conclusion

This was a lot of folks favorite ER pick in Austin last year and it won our Austin Dead Liver Society Eagle Rare blind bracket(but didn't make the top 4 for me...). It's off profile for Eagle Rare and has a weird sweet note that reminds me of EHT Grain of the Gods which I didn't love. That said it was still enjoyable and I'm glad I grabbed one. I really like the usual Eagle Rare profile and may have enjoyed this more if I didn't go in expecting Eagle Rare.

**TL;DR:** Off profile Eagle Rare. Good but not my favorite.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies
