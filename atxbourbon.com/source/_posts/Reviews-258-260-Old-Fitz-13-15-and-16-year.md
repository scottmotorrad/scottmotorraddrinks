I've had a sample of Old Fitz 16 year sitting in an empty Blood Oath Pact 3 box on my desk for some time now so it's time for a review. I'd also been wanting to review the 13 and 15 year for at least as long so here we are with a triple Old Fitz decanter tasting. I tasted these blind, [the video is on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEZhVHxHgYF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and then sat down to write more detailed tasting notes.

## Reviews #258-260: Old Fitzgerald 13, 15 and 16

## Old Fitzgerald 13
**Age**: 13 years

**Abv**: 100 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Soft nose with peanut butter, oak and vanilla frosting

**Taste**: Creamy peanut butter, vanilla, rich oak, faint spice especially toward the end.

**Finish**: Long warm finish with slightly dry oak and spices with a touch of sweetness for balance.

**4 Stars** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite

## Old Fitzgerald 15
**Age**: 15 years

**Taste**: Peanut brittle, caramel, slightly bitter oak.

**Finish**:  

**4 Stars** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite

## Old Fitzgerald 16
**Age**: 16 years

**Abv**: 100 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Vanilla, peanut brittle, rich oak, faint spice.

**Taste**: Rich oak, butterscotch, fainter nuttiness.

**Finish**: Long dry finish with oak and a quickly fading sweetness.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

I've really enjoyed all of these Old Fitz decanters. The 11 and now the 16 were a bit of a step down from the others but not too much. I really enjoy the sweet, nutty and oaky combination. I can only hope we will one day get Larceny BP that is close to the age of these decanters once the Old Fitz BiB run is done. I'm definitely going to need another one as my 13 is getting perilously low.

**TL;DR:** The 13 and 15 are awesome, the 16 is very good but a step down for me
