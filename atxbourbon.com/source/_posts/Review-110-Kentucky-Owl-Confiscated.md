This tater bottle from the Kentucky Owl just hit Austin, Texas and since it was just sitting on the counter at Total Wine I couldn't resist picking one up even at the crazy retail price.

## Kentucky Owl Confiscated
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 96.4 proof

**Color**: A medium to deep amber 

**Price**: $144.99

### Neat
**Nose**:  Warm vanilla and butterscotch with a bit of ethanol

**Taste**: Mostly vanilla butterscotch  with some slightly floral notes and a hint of citrus. A little thin on the mouthfeel but not off-puttingly so.

**Finish**: Medium to short finish with cinnamon sugar and warm spice notes

## Conclusion
Considering the whiskey without the price it's good if somewhat thin and young tasting, the ethanol on the nose, short finish and lack of oak notes. It reminds me a New Riff in that it has some good notes but is just a little too young to be great. I'm going to drink the rest of the bottle and enjoy it well enough but it is not worth the price of admission.

TL:DR If this was ~$60 I'd be happy with my purchase

### Quality
**6** - a good whiskey Iâ€™m still happy to drink

### Value
**Poor** - Overpriced, not worth the money
