Next up in the 1792 series is their midrange bottle the Single Barrel. It sits between the Small batch and [Full Proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/) in both price and proof but let's see where it stands on taste. 

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 98.6 proof (49.3% ABV)

**Color**: A deeper gold, very similar to the Full Proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Heat followed by sweet caramel, oak and hints of spice

**Taste**: More caramel and more oak but the spice notes from the nose don't come through

**Finish**: A short sweet linger and then a sort of weird heat on the very end

### On a rock
**Nose**: The heat is gone but the spice went with it leaving a strong caramel note with hints of oak

**Taste**: Surprisingly about the same as it was neat

**Finish**: Much smoother with the ice and the caramel note seemed to linger longer

## Conclusion

Overall this whiskey is fine but it's sort of the odd man out of the 1792 family. The Full Proof is a little pricier but it's higher proof and better which makes sense but then the Small Batch is somehow cheaper and better. They all have pretty similar notes My baseless theory is that they save the best barrels for full proof store picks so the basic Single Barrel doesn't hold up. 

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this
