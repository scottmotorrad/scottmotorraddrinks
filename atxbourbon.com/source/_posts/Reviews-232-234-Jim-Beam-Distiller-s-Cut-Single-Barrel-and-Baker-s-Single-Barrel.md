Jim Beam recently updated their Single Barrel and Baker's products. The single barrel is now higher proof, NCF and supposedly older while Baker's has moved to a single barrel. The first drop of the new Baker's single barrels here in central Texas were over 8 year old. I waited to long to grab one but I did get a sample of an 8 year 6 month bottle to compare with the new Single Barrel. I've also included a sample of Distiller's Cut to use as a baseline.

## Jim Beam Distiller's Cut
**Age**: 5-6 years

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Price**: $17

### Neat
**Nose**: Cornbread, nuts, vanilla

**Taste**: Just like it smells with a bit of spice toward the end

## Jim Beam Single Barrel

**Abv**: 108 proof

**Price**: $37

### Neat

**Finish**: Medium length spicy finish with a bit of nuts and vanilla

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this


## Baker's 7 Year Single Barrel
**Age**: 8 years 6 months

**Abv**: 107 proof

**Price**: $57

### Neat
**Nose**: Oak, vanilla, warm spice, caramel

**Taste**: Caramel, oak, rye spice, faint nuts. Also a nice thick mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with oak, warm spice and caramel

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion

Well that was a lot of the same tasting notes. The biggest differences were how much grain came through in the Distiller's Cut and how much subtler the nut flavor was in the Baker's. The Baker's was also the only one to really have oak notes for me. The mouthfeel was also noticeably better on the Single Barrel and Baker's.

I enjoyed all of these but I'm not in a hurry to go buy any of them. If you are looking for a midrange bottle on the shelf and like the Beam profile I'd recommend the Single Barrel. I feel like the Baker's is just too expensive for what it is with Knob Creek out there being older, higher proof and cheaper.

**TL;DR:** Baker's > SiB > Distiller's > EW BiB. Baker's is good but too pricey for what it is.
