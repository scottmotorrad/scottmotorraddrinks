I missed two weeks (18 and 19) and will be posting make up Sample Mountains but here we are in week 20 and I am finally going to try Weller Single Barrel! Also a Baby Saz pick. I've not had either of these before so I am pretty excited to see if the Weller SiB lives up to the hype and surprisingly high review scores I've seen for it!

## Sazerac Rye Washington Spirit pick

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 90

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and herbal with vanilla and herbal liqueur notes with subtler oak and rye spice.

**Taste**: Caramel and rye spice notes followed by herbal and oak notes. Nice mouthfeel for the proof

**Finish**: Short, clean finish with quickly fading caramel and herbs.

**Buy a bottle?** Yes at something near retail + shipping, not worth hunting/overpaying

## Weller Single Barrel

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 97

### Neat
**Nose**: Fainter than I expected with honey wheat bread and cinnamon notes.

**Taste**: Wheat bread and baking spice with subtler cinnamon, dark fruit and butterscotch. 

**Finish**: Medium length with cherry syrup and faint cinnamon.

**Buy a bottle?** Maybe? I mean it's a ðŸ¥” so I'd pick it up at retail but it's not worth it.

## Conclusion
The Baby Saz pick was surprisingly nice. I haven't had Baby Saz is a while so maybe it is better than I remember or this pick is just particularly good. Either way for a cheap low proof rye this is hard to beat. If I see a pick in the future I'll definitely grab one.

These are all single barrels so maybe I just didn't get one as good as some of the big review sites but I am shocked that folks gave this such positive reviews. Is it a unicorn? Definitely not. Is it a solid $50 bottle? Sure. Does it make sense in the Weller line up? Not to me. I'd drink Weller Full Proof over this all day. Still I was very happy to get a sample and cure the fomo!

**TL;DR:** The Baby Saz pick was surprisingly good. Weller SiB was enjoyable but I'd rather have Weller Full Proof, 107 or even Weller 12.
