{% asset_img image.jpg "Stagg Jr"%}

After reading several Stagg Jr reviews and recommendations on r/bourbon as well as hearing how it was better than EHT SiB I've been very much wanting to try Stagg Jr. I headed up to [Oak Liquor Cabinet](https://www.instagram.com/oakliquorcabinet/) yesterday to see if they had any; thankfully they did along with some 1792 Full Proof that I'll be reviewing here soon. I had a few folks over to watch some college football and we all gave it a try but I was in no condition to write by the end of the games so I decided to sit down today and give it proper review though I did manage to take the photo of the back of the bottle so there is that.

## Review

**Abv**: 126.4 proof (63.2 ABV)

**Color**: A deep but clear gold

### Neat

**Nose**: Oak and baking spice dominate the nose with hints of something sweeter to come, maybe brown sugar?

**Taste**: Rye spice and brown sugary sweetness blend wonderfully with only a small touch of heat. I was expecting more heat from the high proof. I love the spice and sweet balance

**Finish**: The heat comes through just a bit more on the finish as does the sweet with just a touch of something like chocolate. 

### On a rock

**Nose**: A pleasant aroma of baking spice and rye

**Taste**: The ice tames the spice but doesn't completely chase it away and some fruit notes start to come out. Still rich and sweet like a ripe cherry.

**Finish**: The cherry gives way to a lingering chocolatey finish with just a tingle of spice

## Conclusion 
The neat nose was outstanding and the taste was brilliant either neat or on the rocks though the smoother finish and the cherry notes push on the rocks into first for me. A great whiskey so thanks to all on r/bourbon recommending it. This is right up there with the [Four Roses SiB store picks](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/08/07/Review-1-Four-Rose-Single-Barrel-OBSQ-Recipe/) and [THH](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/08/14/Review-3-Thomas-H-Handy-Sazerac/) for me. I loved the balance of the sweet and spice and the surprising lack of heat despite the high proof. I'm still on the hunt for the GTS and can't wait to compare this with its big brother

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time
