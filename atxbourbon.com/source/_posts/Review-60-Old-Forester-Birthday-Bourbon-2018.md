I'm taking a quick break from my High West series to very cheesily review Old Forester Birthday Bourbon for my birthday! This is another bottle I failed to hunt in 2018 but was thankfully able to enjoy at bars including a couple pours tonight.

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 101 proof

**Color**: Deep dark brown 

**Price**: $20 for a 1.5 oz pour

### Neat
**Nose**: Robust holiday spices and strong, sweet brown sugar. Very nice.

**Taste**: Even more brown sugar than the nose but the distinct holiday spice notes fade into more generic warm baking spice notes; on the plus side some pleasant oak notes are there as well.

**Finish**: Surprisingly short though the sweet and spice were well balanced with hints of oak and a little more heat than I like

## Conclusion
I've had a few pours of this from a couple different bottles and each time I nose it I get really excited and then by the time I get to the finish I am a little let down. That said it is still an excellent bourbon especially if you like things a little hotter. Not worth hunting in my opinion but I would happily buy a bottle at retail.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
