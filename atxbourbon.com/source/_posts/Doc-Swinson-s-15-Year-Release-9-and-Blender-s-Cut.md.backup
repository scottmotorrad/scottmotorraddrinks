I polished off two great bottles from Doc Swinson’s yesterday to make some room for their new releases.

{% asset_img image.jpg "%%" %}

The first is release 9 from their Exploratory Cask Series. It’s a 15 year Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey weighing in at 113.8 proof. It’s sweet and rich upfront with caramel, nuts, vanilla frosting with spice and oak coming in at the end. The mouthfeel is viscous and quite nice for the proof. The slightly dry, spicy finish makes me want to take the next sip. This is an excellent release of a well aged KY bourbon and I’m glad I grabbed one.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


The second bottle is the initial release (20-001) of their Blender’s Cut. It’s a 5 year old Indiana Straight Bourbon Whiskey weighing in at 115 proof. It’s a well blended 5 year old MGP that is more refined than some of the similarly aged single barrels I’ve tried. The nose is warm and sweet with rye spice and caramel. The palate brings in brighter fruit to balance those notes and the clean finish amps up the spice and brings in a bit of vanilla extract.

**Stars**: **1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

While I’ll miss these I’m sure that Funky Drummer and Tres Amigos will fill their space on my shelf.

**TL;DR:** Both were good, the 15 year was great. Looking forward to the new releases.
