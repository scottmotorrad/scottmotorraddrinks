I got super lucky and managed to score this year's EHT Barrel Proof on a little lunchtime hunt. I'd had two of the previous releases and liked them well enough but I'd heard good things about this batch so I decided to crack it straight away. It was a little high octane for a lunch pour but half a bottle later I'm a huge fan. In another crazy turn of events EHT Single Barrel hit Austin last week and wasn't on allocation at some of the bigger shops so I couldn't resist picking one up. I've previously written a side by side of an EHT Single Barrel and Small Batch so I decided to keep the tradition alive and do these side by side!

## Colonel EH Taylor Barrel Proof 2019
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 129.3 proof

**Price**: $89.99

**NCF**: Yes

### Neat
**Nose**: A powerful but inviting nose with sweet caramel, vanilla, rich oak and subtler baking spice and cherry notes.

**Taste**: Very strong flavor with cherry, caramel, vanilla, baking spice and softer oak notes. One of the best mouthfeels I've had on a bourbon, thick and sticky in all the right ways. 

**Finish**: Very long and dry with a sweet cherry start then lingering spice with just enough oak and caramel to balance it.

[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I always try to keep on my shelf

[**Great**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/great-value/) - A great deal, I'd buy it again

## Colonel EH Taylor Single Barrel 2019
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Price**: $69.99

**Laser Code**: L192180123-30L

### Neat
**Nose**: Solid but basic nose with sweet vanilla and caramel notes.

**Taste**: Oak notes dominate with some sweet caramel and vanilla. A little thin for 100 proof but still decently viscous.

**Finish**: Long oaky finish with sweet vanilla notes balancing the oak.

## Conclusion
Wow, this year's Barrel Proof was outstanding. I've had the '17 and '18 at bars and liked them but didn't love them like I do this bottle. This was very nearly a 10/10 but the finish was a little to dry and hot to be perfect for me. I'm very glad I was able to get a bottle this year at a good price and will definitely be trying to track down another one next year!

This Single Barrel was the most oaky and least spicy EHT I've had yet which I really enjoyed. I definitely prefer it to [my last EHT SiB bottle](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/07/05/Reviews-123-124-EHT-Single-Barrel-vs-Small-Batch/). It's still a gamble buying the SiBs vs the SmB for EHT though and not one I would recommend for most folks. I'll probably still bite from time to time if I can get one without any hassle.

**TL;DR:** This years EHT BP is outstanding. The Single Barrel still ranges from good to great.
