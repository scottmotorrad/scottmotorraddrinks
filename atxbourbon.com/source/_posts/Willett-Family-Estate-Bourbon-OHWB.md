Old Hickory Whiskey Bar in Florida picked this Willett barrel a while back. I got to try it via OJ from [Taste Select Repeat](https://tasteselectrepeat.com/) on a New York trip and he let me keep the rest of the bottle.

## Willett Family Estate Bourbon OHWB

**Age**: 8 Years

**Proof**: 137.2

**Barrel #**: 4793

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet fruit notes, spearmint, warm spice. Very classic Willett rye bourbon profile just turned up a notch from most of the bottles I've had. Drinks wonderfully even with the very high proof. Great mouthful. Very long finish with spice, oak and vanilla 

**Stars**: **4** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite


## Conclusion

This was an outstanding Willett pick. Powerful and delicious without being overwhelming. Overall in my top tier of Willett bottles I've had.
