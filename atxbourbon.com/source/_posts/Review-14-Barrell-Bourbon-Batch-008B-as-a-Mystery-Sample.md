## Data
This was my first mystery sample review, courtesy of [u/bananavanman](https://www.reddit.com/user/bananavanman) and it was a lot of fun. I had a sneaking suspicion that this was going to be a Barrell or a Dickel. On the other hand my wife thought the sample bottle looked like poison but I took the  risk and drank it anyway.  

On a side note switching to a Glencairn for my neat tasting was an excellent choice and I'm going to start looking for a similar rocks glass.

**Abv**: 129 proof (64.5% ABV)

**Age**: 10 years

## Review

**Color**: A dark, appealing amber

### Neat

**Nose**: Very sweet with vanilla, almost like a cake, with just a hint of something spicy

**Taste**: Smooth and sweet to start with vanilla notes, bordering on cloying but never quite getting there, a little sticky like a vanilla toffee

**Finish**: The sweetness gives way to warm baking spice and just a touch of a burn. Very nice

### On a rock

**Nose**: The sweetness is still present but is more like sugar or honey than vanilla cake

**Taste**: The ice tames the sweetness and stickiness and the vanilla notes are back, very nice if a bit simple

**Finish**: Smoother with a balance of sweet and spice. The spice lingers nicely

## Conclusion 
I was very excited to get to try another Barrell after my [middling experience](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/14/Review-7-Barrell-Bourbon-Single-Barrel-Select/) with the first bottle. I enjoyed this one much more. While the flavor notes were somewhat similar they way they felt in my mouth and especially the way they lingered along the addition of a small baking spice note brought this much closer to the flavor profiles I enjoy.  

I nearly gave this an 8 but I'm still not sure I would buy a bottle of it now that I've already tried it.
