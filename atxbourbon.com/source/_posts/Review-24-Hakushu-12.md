Hakushu 12 was the whisky that got me into Japanese whisky even though it has fallen a bit behind Nikka as I've continued to explore the wonderful offerings from Japan. Even so given how hard this is too find these days combined with the sentimental value I am trying tot ration it but today was my one year anniversary of moving back to Texas so it felt appropriate. This is also my first Japanese whisky review. I've been hitting bourbon and rye hard but have been meaning to branch out into Japanese and scotch. So here we go.

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 86 proof (43% ABV)

**Color**: A bright gold

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and fruity almost like peaches with floral notes

**Taste**: Smooth and sweet like wildflower honey with light citrus notes and hints of oak

**Finish**: Light and sweet with more citrus notes

### On a rock
**Nose**: Even lighter but still sweet and fruity

**Taste**: The ice really opens it up. The peaches are back and the oak comes through a bit more

**Finish**: Unfortunately short but still sweet

## Conclusion
This whisky is still delightful but it does seem a little simple nowadays. I see why I liked it so much earlier in my whisky journey but it's not really in my top tier anymore. All that said I'd still highly recommend it to folks who prefer lower proof, smooth and sweet whiskies and anyone wanting and easy but delightful intro in Japanese. I'll continue to savor my remaining stock and enjoy the taste alongside the nostalgia.
