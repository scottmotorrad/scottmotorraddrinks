I had the good fortune of attending the Spirit of Speyside festival this year and naturally went to Glenfiddich. Among several awesome experience I got to bottle my own 15 year cask strength NCF bottle.

## Glenfiddich 15 Cask Strength
**Age**: 15 years

**Abv**: 117.8 proof

**Color**: A medium gold

**Price**: 120 GBP

### Neat
**Nose**: Soft and sweet with rich honey and sherry notes. 

**Taste**: An amazing mouthfeel that viscous and velvety with strong notes of sherry, honey, oak and malted grain.  

**Finish**: Medium length finish with warm honey, a bit grain and a little spice.

## Conclusion
This was another delicious whisky from Glenfiddich and continues to highlight how much we are missing out on cask strength releases from them here in the states. I actually asked Ian Miller, the semi retired distillery manager, about the possibility of getting more cask strength releases in the US but he wasn't super forthcoming and I don't have a lot of hope.

I loved the mouthfeel and nose on this one and was especially surprised by how easy it was drink given the proof. I tried the [standard 80 proof 15 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/07/Review-86-Glenfiddich-15-Solera-Reserve/) after this and it was night and day different. All these cask strength single malts are ruining me for the cut down 80-86 proofers. On the other hand compared to [this year's festival bottle, a 15 year Port Pipe matured 117 proof monster](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/05/16/Review-113-Glenfiddich-Spirit-of-Speyside-2019/), this was noticeably less sweet but had a better mouthfeel and was more complex with the spice and oak notes. It was also 80 GBP cheaper so there's that.

If anyone can suggest a cask strength Speyside we can get in the States please let me know!

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle
