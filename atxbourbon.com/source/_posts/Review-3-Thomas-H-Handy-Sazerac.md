## Data
Thomas H. Handy Sazerac is a Rye Whiskey from the [Buffalo Trace Antique collection](http://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/brands/antique-collection#3) and [I found it tonight](https://imgur.com/a/cPbzfHu) at my favorite [North Austin Bar](https://www.drinkwellaustin.com/). I believe this is the 2017 bottling but I am not 100% sure.

**Mashbill**: Unknown but >51% Rye

**Abv**: 126 proof (63.1% ABV)

**Age**: No Age Statement

**Price**: ~$29 USD for a ~1.5 oz pour

## Review

**Color**: A reddish amber

### Neat

**Nose**: Brown sugar with hints of floral honey

**Taste**: The honey turns into a rich butterscotch with a layer of baking spice spice with the brown sugar remaining prevalent throughout

**Finish**: Sweet but a little short with mostly brown sugar and hints of spice

### On a rock

**Nose**: The honey from the neat nose surges to the front with the brown sugar taking a more subtle note

**Taste**: The ice unlocks the sweetness leading to pure butterscotchy bliss

**Finish**: Still sweet and a touch spicy, it didn't particularly change from neat

## Conclusion 
I loved this rye, this is a near 10 for me. If it was on the shelves at [my local shop](http://oakliquorcabinet.com/) I'd buy it in a heartbeat. My wife tasted a bit and said it was like the moment when you pour brown sugar into your cookie batter(maybe she should be writing these reviews) and she usually thinks whiskey tastes like sweet mouthwash haha.

[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I'd like to keep on my shelf
