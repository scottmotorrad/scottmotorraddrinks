## Data
Thomas H. Handy Sazerac is a Rye Whiskey from the [Buffalo Trace Antique collection](http://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/brands/antique-collection#3) and [I found it tonight](https://imgur.com/a/cPbzfHu) at my favorite [North Austin Bar](https://www.drinkwellaustin.com/). I believe this is the 2017 bottling but I am not 100% sure.

**Mashbill**: Unknown but >51% Rye

**Abv**: 126 proof (63.1% ABV)

**Age**: No Age Statement

**Price**: ~$29 USD for a ~1.5 oz pour

## Review

**Color**: A reddish amber

### Neat

**Nose**: Brown sugar with hints of floral honey

**Taste**: The honey turns into a rich butterscotch with a layer of baking spice spice with the brown sugar remaining prevalent throughout

**Finish**: Sweet but a little short with mostly brown sugar and hints of spice

### On a rock

**Nose**: The honey from the neat nose surges to the front with the brown sugar taking a more subtle note

**Taste**: The ice unlocks the sweetness leading to pure butterscotchy bliss

**Finish**: Still sweet and a touch spicy, it didn't particularly change from neat

## Conclusion 
I loved this rye, this is a near 10 for me. If it was on the shelves at [my local shop](http://oakliquorcabinet.com/) I'd buy it in a heartbeat. My wife tasted a bit and said it was like the moment when you pour brown sugar into your cookie batter(maybe she should be writing these reviews) and she usually thinks whiskey tastes like sweet mouthwash haha.

9/10 - I wish I could buy a bottle!

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
