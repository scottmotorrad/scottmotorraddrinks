## Glenfiddich Fire and Cane

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 86

### Neat

**Notes**: Campfire smoke and vanilla creme sweetness. Fainter malt noes with a hint of fruit. Thin mouthfeel and short finish.

**Stars**: **0** - **Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

## Conclusion

I wish this had been a slightly higher proof, NCF release. The rum and smoke notes go together nicely but the dram is just too thin and watery. There is a moment mid palate when I went "this is good" but all too quickly it was gone. Even a 92 proof NCF take would have been a huge upgrade. This bottle really highlights why I have moved away from most OB scotches to focus on higher proof IBs.

**TL;DR:** Enjoyable flavors but the anemic proof is underwhelming
