Bourbon Enthusiast picked an excellent Traverse City Barrel Proof barrel a while back and I'm finally making it to the end of the bottle so it's time for a review.

## Traverse City Bourbon Enthusiast Single Barrel

**Age**: 7 years

**Proof**: 118.4

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is balanced between sweet and spice with caramel, baking spice and black pepper notes. The palate is sweeter with brown sugar, cherry syrup and vanilla balanced by fainter spice and a bit of oak. The mouth feel is nicely viscous and the proof is well integrated. The finish is long especially for the age with a sticky sweet caramel note and just a bit of warm spice. Overall it's a great bourbon and will be missed.


**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Another great MGP pick from Bourbon Enthusiast
