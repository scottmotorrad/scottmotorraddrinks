Part 15 of the finished whiskey series bring me back to Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend with Batch 14. The last few releases have Cigar Blend have come in sets of 4 batches which are all made from the same bourbon blend then finished in different Armagnac casks. In this case 11-14 came from the same blend and I was lucky enough to get 3/4.

## Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Batch 14
**Age**: NAS but all the bourbons are 10+ years

**Abv**: 105.4 proof

**Price**: $170

### Neat
**Nose**: Leather, rich oak, warm spices and sweet vanilla caramel.

**Taste**: More leather and caramel backed by oak, warm spice and brown sugar as well as faint herbal notes towards the end. Thick, viscous mouthfeel

**Finish**: Very long, slightly dry finish with herbs, brown sugar, leather and oak.

## Conclusion
This was a great batch and leaned more towards the darker sweet notes. It was much more balanced than [Batch 13](https://atxbourbon.com/2020/03/24/Review-219-Joseph-Magnus-Cigar-Blend-Batch-13/) but lacked the nice fruit notes from [Batch 12](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/10/06/Review-150-Joseph-Magnus-Cigar-Blend-Batch-12/) otherwise it was relatively similar. The finish was surprisingly not spicy at all which is uncommon for Cigar Blend in my experience.

These are definitely my gold standard for what finished bourbon can be.

**TL;DR:** Not quite batch 12 but still very delicious


[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I always try to keep on my shelf

[**Fair**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/fair-value/) - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
