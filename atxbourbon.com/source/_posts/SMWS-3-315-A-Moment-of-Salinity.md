This was one of the first peated bottles I grabbed from SMWS. The combination of being "lightly" peated and it being Bowmore won me over.

## SMWS 3.315 A Moment of Salinity

**Age**: 16 Years

**Proof**: 113

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is coastal with soft smoke, medium saltiness and a meaty note. The palate brings me to a BBQ on the beach with salted, smoked meat, vanilla cream and faint spice. The finish is long and dry with smoke and salt.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion
This was an excellent bottle. It brought the perfect level of smoke and the savory notes I like from a good peated scotch. The second fill hogshead isn't doing a ton so most of the flavor here comes from the well oxidized distillate and I am a fan.

**TL;DR:** My kind of Islay Scotch
