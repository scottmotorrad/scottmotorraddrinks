I was curious about these sleek black Binder's Stash bottles and decided to pull the trigger with Barrel #1012 and then grabbed 1011 as well. They are both solidly aged, higher proof and distilled in Bardstown, KY. There aren't that many options for distilled in Bardstown which was fueled speculation that at least some of these were sourced from Willett.

## Binder's Stash Barrel 1011

**Age**: 10 years

**Proof**: 119.7 proof

**Notes**: Sticky caramel, lots of spice and oak, brown sugar drank hotter than the other, subtler fruit notes, a bit of leather

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

## Binder's Stash Barrel 1012

**Age**: 9.7 years

**Proof**: 124 proof

**Notes**: Dried fruit, mint, bubblegum, warm spice, caramel and oak on the finish

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Conclusion

1012 was the clear winner for me and I ended up grabbing a backup. It was definitely on profile for Willett and putting it up against some WFE Single Barrels blind it was close (if not quite at that level). Given the crazy prices on Willett these days the ~250 felt fine on this one for me. The 1011 was also quite good but not at the same level. I enjoyed every drop and while I am not looking for a backup there I will certainly be looking for the next releases.

**TL;DR:** 1011 was good but 1012 was something else and definitely reminded me of Willett.
