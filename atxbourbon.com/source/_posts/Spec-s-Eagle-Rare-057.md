## Spec's Eagle Rare Barrel #057

**Age**: 10 years

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose brings cherries and forest notes. More cherry and oak along with other earthy notes on the palate. A pleasant mouthfeel which is great for the proof. The finish is surprisingly long with dried cherry, faint spice and oak notes.

**Stars**: **1** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion

The notes here literally reminds me of drinking a cherry coke zero in a forest in northern Seattle. So that's cool for me but probably doesn't help anyone else much. It dials up the cherry and earthy notes I usually get from Eagle Rare and manages to punch above its weight in terms of proof. Spec's continues to bring good picks for a big box store and I hope start to see them again one day.

**TL;DR:** A solid Eagle Rare pick that leans in on the cherry and earthy notes.
