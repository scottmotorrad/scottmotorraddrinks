I haven't had much from Braeval but I was curious to try this indie bottling from Total Wine. I've now had it for years and finally got through it.

## Alexander Murray Braes of Glenlivet 1994 21 Year

**Age**: 21 years

**Proof**: 86

**Cask Type**: Ex-bourbon

### Neat

**Notes**: Easy nose with no proof sting and a bit of sweetness. Simple and sweet on the palate with pear and vanilla notes. A bit of oak and spice but mostly the fruit and vanilla on the short, clean finish. The anemic proof shows on the mouthfeel and .

**Stars**: **0** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

## Conclusion

While this was enjoyable it was unremarkable. A more active barrel, higher proof or less filtration may have helped make this more interesting. 

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Fine but nothing to write home about.
