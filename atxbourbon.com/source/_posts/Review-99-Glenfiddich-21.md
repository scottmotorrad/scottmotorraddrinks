This is the second of three 21 year old Speyside single malts in this series. We started with the [Glenfarclas 21](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/24/Review-96-Glenfarclas-21/) and will be following up with the Balvenie 21 Portwood. Let's see how this stacks up against the Glenfarclas.

## Glenfiddich 21
**Age**: 21 years

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A medium gold 

**Price**: $179.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and delicate with floral, fruity and honey notes.

**Taste**: Sweet honey notes and complimented by banana and warm spice with a decent mouthfeel given the low proof.

**Finish**: Long and dry with warm spice and malt notes.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion
This was very good and pretty different from the rest of the Speysides I've reviewed so far. I like the notes the rum casks impart though I was a little disappointed with the proof drop from 86 to 80 from the 18 year to the 21 year. It was  close call between this and the Glenfarclas 21 but I preferred the more traditional sherry notes of the Glenfarclas.

Overall it's a great bottle but I don't think it justifies the price jump from the [Glenfiddich 18 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/20/Review-43-Glenfiddich-18/). That said, if you can find it on a decent sale it's a solid pickup.
