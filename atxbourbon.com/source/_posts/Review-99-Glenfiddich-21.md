This is the second of three 21 year old Speyside single malts in this series. We started with the [Glenfarclas 21](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/24/Review-96-Glenfarclas-21/) and will be following up with the Balvenie 21 Portwood. Let's see how this stacks up against the Glenfarclas.

## Glenfiddich 21
**Age**: 21 years

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A medium gold 

**Price**: $179.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and delicate with floral, fruity and honey notes.

**Taste**: Sweet honey notes and complimented by banana and warm spice with a decent mouthfeel given the low proof.

**Finish**: Long and dry with warm spice and malt notes.

## Conclusion
This was very good and pretty different from the rest of the Speysides I've reviewed so far. I like the notes the rum casks impart though I was a little disappointed with the proof drop from 86 to 80 from the 18 year to the 21 year. It was  close call between this and the Glenfarclas 21 but I preferred the more traditional sherry notes of the Glenfarclas.

Overall it's a great bottle but I don't think it justifies the price jump from the [Glenfiddich 18 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/20/Review-43-Glenfiddich-18/) which keeps it out of the 9 rating though. That said, if you can find it on a decent sale it's a solid pickup.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid neat and/or would happily use as a mixer

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - not drinking this neat but it's fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch, but preferably not drinking it

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
