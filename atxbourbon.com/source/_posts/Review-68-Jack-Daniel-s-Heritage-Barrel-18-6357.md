{% asset_img image.jpg "Heritage Barrel"%}

My little brother is in the Airforce and apparently drinking Jack Daniel's is an important part of his squadron which motivated me to try some of the fancier JD bottlings to see if I could find something good in their line up. I saw that Whiskey Advocate put this as [number 3 in their top 20](http://whiskyadvocate.com/top20/2018/3-jack-daniels-single-barrel-heritage-barrel/) for the year, saw it used toasted barrels and was bottled at 100 proof and decided to give it a go.

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 100 proof (also the barrel entry proof)

**Color**: A deep, red amber

**Price**: $59.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Strong vanilla and warm baking spices, especially clove, with caramel and oak notes

**Taste**: More of the same notes, the rich vanilla and sweet caramel are brilliantly balanced by warm spice and toasted oak and are backed up by an excellent mouthfeel. Very nice.

**Finish**: The sweetness fades to a warm, almost hot, spicy and oaky finish with a good linger

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice tames the spices a bit and mutes the oak leaving strong vanilla and caramel notes with baking spice in the background

**Taste**: Just as good as the neat taste and mouthfeel with slightly less spice and a hint of Jack Daniel's signature banana note.

**Finish**: A little shorter than neat with more sweetness though, caramel, spice and banana notes

## Conclusion
I love this stuff it's great neat or on the rocks and is easily the best JD I've ever had. These JD SiBs have changed my mind about the company's ability to make bourbon and this was head and shoulders the best one. I ended up buying 3 bottles though in a moment of weakness gave one to my little brother for Christmas. Also this bottle made me realize that I don't know much about low entry proof whiskies, but now I want to.
