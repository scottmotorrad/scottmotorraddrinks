Last night we tasted a little EHT BP Flight. Given that we didn't have any particular biases we just tasted these in proof order.

Batch 10 was the lowest proof at 127.3. It was my winner and was the most complex of the bunch even if it wasn't as sweet. It also had the best finish.

Next up was Batch 6 at 128.1 proof. This was the clear last place (literally everyone had it last). It started off nice and was thick and viscous but there was a weird bitterness toward the end and it stood out as hot even in this lineup. That said it was still good.

The 3rd one we tasted was also my third place with the new Batch 11 weighing in at 129 proof. It had a really nice nose and good flavors. The finish was fine but didn't impress compared to other batches in the lineup.

Finally we have Batch 8 at 129.3 proof. This was my second place. It was well balanced on the sweet side with cherry and spice but not too much oak. It was a tough call between this and Batch 10.

TLDR: B10 > B8 > B11 > B6
