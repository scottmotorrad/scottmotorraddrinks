To set the scene I don't particularly care for Canadian whiskey apart from some ryes such as whatever Whistle Pig and Treaty Oak are sourcing. So when these Canadian Rare Perfections and Old St Nicks hit I initially trusted my instincts and ignored them. Then I got curious with all the drama and wildly varying reviews so when I got the chance to get a bottle for below retail I figured it was a 14 year old whiskey, it can't be bad even if I do end up overpaying for the quality. So I bought one and let's find out how wrong I was...

## Rare Perfection 14 year 2020 release
**Age**: 14 years

**Abv**: 100.7 proof

**Price**: $125

### Neat
**Nose**: Off putting with notes of plastic, maple and vanilla with hints of oak

**Taste**: Still slightly plastic tasting but with some solid caramel, maple and warm spice notes.

**Finish**: Long and lingering with warm spice, vanilla and maple notes. 

## Conclusion
Well that was bad. I added some Coke Zero and it got worse somehow. I don't have much to say here. I took the tater bait and lost.

**TL;DR:** I liked the finish but nothing else

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this
