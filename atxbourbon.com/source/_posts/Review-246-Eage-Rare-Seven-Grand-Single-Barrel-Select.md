Happy 4th of July!

Nothing says the 4th to me like bourbon and BBQ. I was a day off doing a big brisket smoke yesterday but thankfully there's plenty left to celebrate today. On the bourbon front Eagle Rare is definitely a favorite when it comes to BBQ pairing. At 90 proof it's much easier to drink for an extended period than a barrel proofer, at 10 years old it's got plenty of flavor so I'd you want to throw it over ice to hang outside while you BBQ it can stand up to that and a ~$30 it's a great one to share with no regrets on a one weekend bottle kill! Even better is a good store pick.

This pick is from Seven Grand here in Austin Texas, which is pretty pretty similar the Seven Grand in San Diego. Unfortunately I don't have any more information on the pick :/

## Review #246 Eagle Rare Seven Grand Single Barrel Select
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Price**: $35

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and earthy with rich caramel, oak vanilla and red fruit(cherry?) notes

**Taste**: Caramel, cherry, oak fainter vanilla and a hint of spice. Great mouthfeel especially for the lower proof.

**Finish**: Medium length with a bit more spice than the taste but still lots of caramel and cherry, less oak. 

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed that one. It was very on profile for Eagle Rare for me but with more intense expressions of the sweet and earthy notes I like about Eagle Rare. I would have gladly bought another bottle or two but the shop selling them was strict on the 1 per person. Hopefully they'll still have bottles left at the bar when COVID settles down my personal bottle is gone.
