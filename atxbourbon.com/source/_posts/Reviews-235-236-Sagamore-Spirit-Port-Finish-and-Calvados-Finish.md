Part 17 of the finished whiskey series takes a look at all 3 finished offerings from Sagamore Spirit out of Maryland. They are a relatively new player out of Maryland who are taking the well worn path of sourcing MGP while their own distillate ages. They do stand out a bit by producing some interesting blends between different rye mashbills and each year for 3 running they have released a finished expression. I'd been sleeping on this year's release the Calvados Finish so far but when my neighbor picked up a bottle it was time to do a blind tasting against the Port Finish and [Cognac Finish](https://atxbourbon.com/2020/03/14/Review-215-Sagamore-Spirit-Cognac-Finish/).

## Conclusion

The Cognac finish was the clear winner for both of us though I put the Calvados above the Port while he had them the other way. The Port and Calvados were close for me. The apples from the Calvados really came through for me in the blind which made guessing pretty easy :)

The Port Finish was a step down from [High West's Mid Winter Night's Dram](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/11/21/Review-160-163-High-West-AMidwinter-Nights-Dram-Acts-2-5-6-and-7/). I haven't had a Calvados finished rye other than this one so I don't have a good comparison. I liked both of these whiskies but I'm not running out to buy either one.

**TL;DR:** The Cognac finish is the best of the run so far, these were good but nothing special
