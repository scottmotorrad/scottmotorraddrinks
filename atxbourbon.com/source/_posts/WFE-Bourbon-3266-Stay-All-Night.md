## Willett Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon 'Stay All Night'
 
**Age**: 6 years

**Proof**: 117 proof

**Barrel No**: 3266

**Price**: $130

**Nose**: Fruit jam, honey wheat bread, vanilla cream, faint baking spices

**Taste**: Butterscotch, honey, sweet cream, wheat bread and faint spice with very little oak. Great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: A bit of young grain and oak come through on the finish but otherwise it is more of the same.

**3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

The nose on this is fantastic but unfortunately the nose is the best part of the dram and it sort of fell off from there. The taste was very, on par with many a solid Weller Antique pick, and the finish reminded me how young this bottle was. If I had to pick I'd go with an underwhelming nose building up to an excellent finish instead of the other way around.

When I had a chance to get a backup on one of these I went with its brother [Highway Kind](https://atxbourbon.com/2020/09/11/Review-263-Willett-Family-Estate-Bottled-Single-Barrel-Bourbon-Highway-Kind/) without a second thought.

**TL;DR:** Fantastic nose that winds down from there. Overall great dram but the price and scarcity make it not worth hunting.
