Pappy New Year r/bourbon! In addition to tasting through the 2019 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection I also succeeded in tasting through the 2019 Van Winkle Collection. It's been a fun and delicious, if expensive, month or so around here. This was the first time I was able to try the Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye and only the 2nd or 3rd taste of most of the other Van Winkles, [Old Rip excluded of course](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/05/19/Review-114-Old-Rip-Van-Winkle-2018/). I didn't secure any Van Winkle bottles this year so these were mostly bar pours at Nickel City with one taste at drink.well and one tasting at a liquor store. 

The tasting notes are in the order that I tasted them in.

## Conclusion
Those were some good whiskies even if most of there weren't amazing. 

The Lot B a step up from Weller 12 but not a big one imo. It's got that wheat sweetness, nice oak and it's low proof and easy to drink. There's nothing offensive about it but it's a touch boring. If it were priced based on it $80 MSRP it would be a nice pour from time to time but nothing to seek out and certainly not something worth hunting/overpaying for.

The Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye had an amazing nose. I'd be interested in a cologne, deodorant, body wash or candle with those notes. The taste was more of the same but a little muted and the thin mouthfeel was disappointing. I think a few more points of proof would turn this into a 9/10 for me. I preferred to it this year's Handy and Saz 18.

Pappy 15 tends to be the consensus pick for the best of the Van Winkle line up and this year I agree. Based off the nose, palate and mouthfeel I was going to give PVW15 a 10/10 but the finish was a let down and knocked it back down to 9/10. Is this bottle worth all the Pappy mania? Certainly not. Would I buy and drink this at or near its retail price? All day.

My personal favorite of the Van Winkles tend to be the Old Rip Van Winkle. This year's Wizard Pappy didn't have the cherry note that I got from the 2018 which bumped it down a point. It was still very delicious and I haven't given up hope of acquiring a bottle.

This year's Pappy 20 reminded me a lot of Rhetoric 25 but without the warm spice notes. It was all oak, but not harsh and only slightly bitter compared to last year's release which I thought was too bitter and astringent. Still I wouldn't regularly drink this even if I could for a reasonable price, though I wouldn't say no to a pour. It was my least favorite of the bunch.

Pappy 23 is the rarest and most expensive of the bunch but didn't live up to that for me. For such as old, oaky bourbon it was surprisingly easy to drink and still had more to the taste than just oak. The mouthfeel was thin but still nice somehow which was surprising to me. I liked it quite a bit but not for the retail price much less secondary or bar pour cost.

Overall the Van Winkle line up consists of good bourbon, with 2 standouts and a very solid rye. Pappy mania has blown these way out of proportion but I think the backlash can go too far as well. The 10 and 15 in particular are outstanding whiskies that I would love to have better access to.

**TL;DR:** Old Rip and Pappy 15 are the best of the bunch, the rye was no slouch either
