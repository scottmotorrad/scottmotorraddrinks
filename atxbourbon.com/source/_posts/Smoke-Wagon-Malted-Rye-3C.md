## Smoke Wagon Malted Rye 3C

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 119.6 - I think; the hand written proof is hard to read


### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is what I would expect from a good MGP rye with sweet, rich herbs, rye spice and vanilla extract. The mouthfeel is excellent as is the proof integration. The palate starts sweet with vanilla cream before getting into more herbal territory. The finish is long, slightly spicy and slightly dry with oak, rye spice and vanilla notes. The herbs are never overly dill forward which is nice for me.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


**TL;DR:** One of the better MGP sourced ryes you can actually get without a hassle
