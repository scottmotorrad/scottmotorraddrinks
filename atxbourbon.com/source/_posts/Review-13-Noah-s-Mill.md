## Info
My [favorite bar](https://www.drinkwellaustin.com/) added some new bourbon's to their list tonight so it's time for another review. To avoid getting a divorce, I only typed up notes at the bar for one dram. Anyways this bourbon is from Willet/KBD though I am unclear on whether it is distilled there or sourced.

**Mashbill**: Unknown

**Abv**: 114.3 proof (57.15% ABV)

**Age**: NAS, this brand used to carry a 15 year statement but not anymore

## Review
**Color**: A deep gold

### Neat
**Nose**: Very pleasant full of fruity notes with dark cherry and something else I couldn't place

**Taste**: a little hot but sweet with more dark cherries and caramel notes with hints of oak

**Finish**: warm and delicious with a brown sugar that borders on molasses

### On a rock
**Nose**: lightens and opens it up a lot but unfortunately brings out a touch of acetone on the first sniff that quickly gives way to something almost like red velvet cake

**Taste**: Much smoother but still with predominantly sweet notes, still good but I missed the cherries

**Finish**: Cut short by the ice but the sweetness lingered just long enough to make me want the next sip 

## Conclusion
This bottle was very good and I'd be happy to buy a bottle. I'm torn on whether I preferred this neat or on nice and can definitely drink it either way. Definitely glad I got to try this and its little brother Rowan's Creek(no review but not nearly as good).
