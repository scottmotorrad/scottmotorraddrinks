Today is the start of the last season of Game of Thrones and what better time than to post my review of Oban's The Night's Watch. Oban went very light on the details about this bottling but it ended up as one of the more hyped Game of Thrones bottles. I'm a fan of [the Oban 14](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/01/20/Review-65-Oban-14/) and of another GoT bottling in the [Lagavulin 9 year House Lannister](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/09/Reviews-72-74-Lagavulin-8-9-and-16-year/) and was very excited to see how this stacked up!

## Oban Game of Thrones The Night's Watch
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $61.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with rich dark fruit and crisp citrus notes.

**Taste**: Strong dark cherry and warm spice notes with hints of oak and a surprisingly viscous mouthfeel given the proof.

**Finish**: Medium to long finish with sweet cherry and a bit of spice.

## Conclusion
First off this is another great dram from Oban and the Game of Thrones series. This bottle was very sherry forward and lacked any of the smokey notes from the 14 year giving it quite a different profile than I've come to expect from Oban. That said, I do like sherried single malts so it's no surprise this one was right up my alley. I'd happily buy another bottle at retail but that seems extremely unlikely at this point.
