Today is the start of the last season of Game of Thrones and what better time than to post my review of Oban's The Night's Watch. Oban went very light on the details about this bottling but it ended up as one of the more hyped Game of Thrones bottles. I'm a fan of [the Oban 14](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/01/20/Review-65-Oban-14/) and of another GoT bottling in the [Lagavulin 9 year House Lannister](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/09/Reviews-72-74-Lagavulin-8-9-and-16-year/) and was very excited to see how this stacked up!

## Oban Game of Thrones The Night's Watch
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $61.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with rich dark fruit and crisp citrus notes.

**Taste**: Strong dark cherry and warm spice notes with hints of oak and a surprisingly viscous mouthfeel given the proof.

**Finish**: Medium to long finish with sweet cherry and a bit of spice.

## Conclusion
First off this is another great dram from Oban and the Game of Thrones series. This bottle was very sherry forward and lacked any of the smokey notes from the 14 year giving it quite a different profile than I've come to expect from Oban. That said, I do like sherried single malts so it's no surprise this one was right up my alley. I'd happily buy another bottle at retail but that seems extremely unlikely at this point.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
