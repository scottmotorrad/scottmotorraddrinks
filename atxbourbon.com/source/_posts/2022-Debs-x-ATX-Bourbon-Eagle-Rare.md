## 2022 Debs x ATX Bourbon Eagle Rare

**Age**: 10.5 years

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet and earthy. The nose reminds me of being in a forest in the PNW. The palate brings big oak and cherry notes with subtler spice, caramel and vanilla. The finish is long and slightly dry with more oak and vanilla. Great mouthfeel for the proof. 

## Conclusion

One of my favorite ER picks of all time but obviously I'm biased. We picked this pack in 2022 and I wish I had grabbed a couple more. On the other hand my dad still has his so maybe it's time for a trip.

**TL;DR:** Like normal Eagle Rare but more flavor especially the cherry and a very long finish
