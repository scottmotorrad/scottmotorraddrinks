## Jack Daniel's Decoy Hill

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 135.1

### Neat

**Notes**: Bananas and baking spice plus a good amount of ethanol burn throughout. Once you get past the ethanol it's sort of like a boozy banana bread with a caramel butter spread.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


## Conclusion

This is great neat if you can get past the proof or if you dilute it a bit. More importantly it is one of my favorite whiskies to use in an Old Fashioned.

**TL;DR:** A great JD pick that leans into the things that make JD barrel proof so tasty
