Thanks to the folks at Bardstown for the bottle! Since I was gifted the bottle I will not be assigning a score.

## American Highway Reserve Route 2

**Age**: 4-12 year blend

**Proof**: 98

### Neat

**Notes**: Raisins, fresh cut wood, slightly bitter herbs, caramel, holiday spice

**TL;DR:** Big upgrade from Route 1. The GA bourbon does great work like it does in Discovery Series 9
