{% asset_img image.jpg "Glenfiddich 12"%}

I'm in Seattle for work this week and the liquor prices are crazy here so it seemed like a good time to grab some mini bottles of Glenfiddich's entry level single malt. I've had this dram many times over the years and tend to enjoy it more as a mixer but let's see how it stacks up today!

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 80 proof 

**Color**: A medium gold

**Price**: $38.99(for a 750ml back home)

### Neat
**Nose**: Light and sweet with primarily pear and malt notes and hints of citrus and oak

**Taste**: Medium bodied with malt and oak alongside light citrus notes. The mouthfeel is a little thin but that's expected with the low ABV

**Finish**: Short and simple finish

### On a rock
**Nose**: Mostly malt with fainter pair and oak notes

**Taste**: The ice improves the mouthfeel but brings out a slightly bitter note alongside the oak and malt

**Finish**: Slightly shorter than it was neat

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

## Conclusion
This is the entry level Glenfiddich and it shows in the lack of complexity especially compared to the excellent 15 year. That said the  notes that are there are pleasant and there's nothing wrong with it. While I'm not the biggest fan of this neat or on ice I do enjoy it in Highball or Penicillin. If you want a single malt for mixing and that you can also drink neat at a reasonable price this a solid choice.
