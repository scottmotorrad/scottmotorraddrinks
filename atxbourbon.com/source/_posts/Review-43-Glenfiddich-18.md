I went to an awesome Glenfiddich event at [drink.well](https://www.instagram.com/drinkwellaustin/) this weekend which helped reignite my love for the distillery. Glenfiddich is a Speyside distillery and is one of the most popular ones in the world so you probably already know about them :) Let's get to the tasting notes!

## Review
**Age**: 18 years

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A medium, burnished gold

**Price**: $104.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Fruity, sweet and warm like a holiday apple pie

**Taste**: Rich notes of apple and cinnamon sugar with a hint of oak. A very nice mouthfeel

**Finish**: A long, warm and mildly spicy finish with oak and cinnamon notes

### On a rock
**Nose**: Bright and sweet with pear and honey notes

**Taste**: Candied pear notes slowly fade into allspice and a touch of oak

**Finish**: Medium length with notes of allspice and oak

## Conclusion
I love this whiskey. It's got a great balance of sweet and spice that comes from the combo of bourbon barrel aged and sherry aged casks. I'm a fan of the versatility as it's great neat when it's cold outside with the holiday pie notes and also works well as a brighter summer whiskey on the rocks. The extra 6 proof also really up the mouthfeel game compared to the 15 expression. The main downside to this one is the price but I tend to stock up on Twin Liquors Dollar Days sale which alleviates that concern! I was about to give this an 8 until I realized I don't remember the last time it wasn't on my shelf. While it might not be as flashy as some of my other 9s it's definitely up there.

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf
