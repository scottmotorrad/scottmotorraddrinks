The 1792 series continues and this time we are getting into some of the rare stocks with the 225th Anniversary. This one took a bit of work to track down as it was a one time commemorative release to celebrate the 225th anniversary of Kentucky joining the union, mostly for good. Otherwise this is a small batch, extra aged release in the same odd bottle shape that confounds my whiskey organization attempts.

## Review
**Age**: NAS but the bottle says "nearly a decade"

**Abv**: 92.15 proof (46.075% ABV)

**Color**: A deep amber with hints of red

### Neat
**Nose**: Starts with a sweet brown sugar note complimented by dark cherries and a bit of balancing  baking spice

**Taste**: Very similar to the nose though the spice is a bit more muted. This could easily fill in for a cherry pie as a dessert. Excellent mouthfeel especially given the middling proof

**Finish**: A little shorter and hotter than I would have liked. The baking spice mingles with the brown sugar in this medium length, medium heat finish.

### On a rock
**Nose**: The spice is gone leaving the intoxicating brown sugar and cherry combination

**Taste**: The baking spice and cherries comes to the forefront with the brown sugar note taking a back seat. Even better than it was neat. Oddly the ice actually made this feel a bit thinner in the mouthfeel for me.

**Finish**: The heat from the neat finish is gone and the spice and brown sugar notes remain for a medium duration.

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


## Conclusion
First off this whiskey was excellent as I've come to expect from the higher end 1792 expressions (I'll have to do the small batch at some point haha). I really enjoyed the fruity notes in this one and wasn't expecting them. Surprisingly the neat finish was a bit hotter than the [1792 Full Proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/) despite coming in over 32 proof points lower. The hot but sort of short finish kept it out of the 9 territory but just barely! My favorite 1792 so far but only by a nose.
