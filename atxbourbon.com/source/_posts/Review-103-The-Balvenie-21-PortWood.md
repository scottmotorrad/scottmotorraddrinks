This is the third and final 21 year old Speyside single malt in this series. We started with the [Glenfarclas 21](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/24/Review-96-Glenfarclas-21/) followed up with the [Glenfiddich 21](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/30/Review-99-Glenfiddich-21/) and are finishing it off with the Balvenie 21 Portwood. Let's see how this stacks up against the Glenfarclas and the Glenfiddich.

## Balvenie 21 Portwood
**Age**: 21 years

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $199.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich, sweet dark cherry and sherry notes dominate the nose. 

**Taste**: Honey, dark cherry, cream and warm spice notes compliment a nice and viscous mouthfeel, especially for the proof.

**Finish**: Long and sweet with honey, hints of dark fruit and gentle spice notes.

## Conclusion
This was easily my favorite of the 3 and the only one I'd semi-regularly pick over it's 17/18 year brethren which made me realize that I haven't written about the younger Balvenie selections yet so I'll have get on that. The Port influence was clear throughout and I'm a big fan of Ported whiskies so it was no surprise I loved this. It was primarily sweet and fruity with just enough spice to give it depth. 

Apparently there is a duty free exclusive version of this that is NCF and 95.2 proof so I'll be keeping an eye out for that on my next international trip!

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.


**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
