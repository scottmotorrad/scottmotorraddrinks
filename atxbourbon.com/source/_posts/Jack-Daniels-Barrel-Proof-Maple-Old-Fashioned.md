Thanks to u/PucksNPlucks over on Reddit for suggesting this recipe. In [a thread about Stagg Jr](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/j7gikb/stagg_jr_batch_12/) someone suggested using it to make an Old Fashioned to which u/PucksNPlucks suggested using Jack Daniel's Barrel Proof. I have a 375ml bottle of the stuff that's been chilling for a while as well as the other ingredients so it seemed like a good time to mix 1 or 2 up and try writing about a cocktail!

## Jack Daniels Barrel Proof Maple Old Fashioned

### Recipe

* 2oz JD BP
* 2 dashes Angostura Bitters
* 3 dashes Orange bitters
* 1 teaspoon dark maple syrup

### On a rock

**Nose**: Strong banana and maple notes with subtler citrus

**Taste**: Bananas foster but with maple instead of caramel and some vanilla towards the end

**Finish**: Maple, citrus and vanilla ice cream


## Conclusion

I quite liked this. Apart from the 2019 Heritage Barrel release I tend to only drinks JD when I'm in the mood for the banana notes but it was excellent in a cocktail. The high proof and strong base spirit
flavors really cut through the cocktail so that the bitters and maple syrup felt very much like they were adding to the flavor of the whiskey instead of masking it.

**TL;DR:** The strong banana notes in Jack Daniel's Barrel Proof make for an excellent rendition of a classic cocktail.
