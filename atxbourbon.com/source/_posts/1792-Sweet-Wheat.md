A while back I went through a big 1792 craze and bought entirely too many bottles of their whiskey. I'm slowly catching up on reviewing them.

## 1792 Sweet Wheat
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 91.2 proof

**Color**: A medium amber 

### Neat
**Nose**: Vanilla, oak, butterscotch, citrus and banana

**Taste**: Very sweet with butterscotch, vanilla, oak and spice a little thin on the mouthfeel but solid for the proof

**Finish**: Medium length finish with vanilla, oak and light spice

## Conclusion
I am a big fan of wheaters in general and this is solid entry that category so it's no surprise I liked it. I'd put it over a readily available offering like Larceny, Maker's or even Weller Special Reserve that said it falls a bit short of something in a similar price/scarcity range like Weller Antique 107. Maybe it would be able to compete if this were bottled at a higher proof? I'll never understand why 1792 releases most things at less than 100 proof ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That said this is a super accessible drinker with great flavors so if you are in the mood for sweet, smooth and easy to drink this is checks all those boxes.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies
