It's been a while since I wrote anything about Four Roses after [the long, meandering exploration of their different recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/exe981/four_roses_blind_finale_and_series_wrapup/). The Four Roses Small Batch Select launched last year and was the first line expansion from Four Roses in years. It sits between their regular Single Barrel offering and their Private Selections in both proof and price.

## Review #244 Four Roses Small Batch Select
**Age**: 6+ years according to the neck tag

**Abv**: 104 proof

**Price**: $55

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet fruit and warm spice notes with hints of vanilla and oak.

**Taste**: Vanilla, oak, dark fruit and baking spices notes backed by a viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long, warm and somewhat spicy with more baking spice notes balanced with subtler herbal, oak and vanilla notes

## Conclusion

This was a great bottle but it's hard to want to go grab another one instead of just stocking up on Four Roses Private Selections when they hit town. That said for folks who want a higher proof, NCF Four Roses option that's readily available you can't go wrong with this one. On the other hand if you are more price sensitive it's hard to say if this is worth the upgrade from the Single Barrel from a value perspective.


**TL;DR:** Solid Four Roses offering you can actually find


[**7**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/7/) - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar

[**Fair**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/fair-value/) - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
