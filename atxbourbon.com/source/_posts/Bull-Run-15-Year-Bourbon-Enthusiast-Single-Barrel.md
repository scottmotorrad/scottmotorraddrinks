The Bourbon Enthusiast Bull Run 15 Year is a single barrel straight bourbon whiskey rumored to be from Jim Beam. It uses the same mystery mashbill that so many other 15 year old bourbons have lately so let's see if it tastes like it too.

## Bull Run 15 Year Bourbon Enthusiast Single Barrel

**Age**: 15 years

**Proof**: 108.18

**Mashbill**: 78.5% corn, 13% rye, 8.5% malted barley

### Neat

**Nose**: Rich with nuts, oak and caramel balancing each other nicely and a hint of cherry

**Taste**:  Thick and creamy with more nuts, caramel and oak plus some warm baking spices

**Finish**:  Long, slightly dry and warm with lingering oak and barrel spice balanced by a bit of milk chocolate

## Conclusion

Overall this is a great bottle and I’m glad to be back in the Bourbon Enthusiast barrel club! I hope we start to see more well aged single barrels from Bull Run’s Independent Bottling Collection. This is definitely from the same source as Doc Swinson's, Old Bones and Three Cord's 15 year releases and stands up well in that company.

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle
