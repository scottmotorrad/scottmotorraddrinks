The Woodford series is still going and we're at the penultimate entry with a side by side of Woodford Double Oaked and a Spec's pick. Woodford Double Oaked batches regular Woodford Reserve and ages it a bit longer in a second, toasted new oak barrel. The store picks are single barrels of the second barreling but are still batched after the first maturation. I originally tasted both of these blind and side by side but took the notes later on and not blind.

## Woodford Double Oaked
**Age**: NAS years

**Abv**: 90.4 proof

**Price**: $47.99

### Regular Double Oak
**Nose**: Very wood forward with predominantly rich oak and sweet caramel with fainter nutty and malty notes in the background.

**Taste**: The strong oak and caramel notes from the nose carry forward to the taste alongside some warm baking spice, vanilla, malt and a bit of fresh herbs. Decent mouthfeel overall but good for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium length, mostly sweet finish with less oak than I expected with floral honey and minty herbal notes.

### Spec's Pick
**Nose**: More complex with rich oak, sweet caramel, fresh herbal, malted grain and slightly spicy notes.

**Taste**: Spice forward with warm baking spice, more oak and caramel and a bit of the malt. Slightly thinner mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with spice and mint notes.

## Conclusion
I enjoyed both these though I won't be in a hurry to grab another bottle of either. 

I did a blind side by side of these a while back at Woodford tasting and I preferred the the Spec's pick then but not by much. I think I still do but it's pretty close. It was spicier and had a more complex nose but a thinner mouthfeel.

Looking outside the Woodford range my 'gold standard' for double oaked bourbon is Blood Oath Pact 4 and neither one of these compared favorably.

And lastly here's the obligatory 'why don't they release a 100-110 proof version of this??" from all my Woodford reviews.

**TL;DR:** Both were a step up from the standard Woodford, store pick was different but not better
