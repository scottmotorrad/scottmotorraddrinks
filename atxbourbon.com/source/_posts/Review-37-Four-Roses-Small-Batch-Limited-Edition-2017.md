Another great pour from [The Roosevelt Room](https://www.instagram.com/rooseveltroomatx/?hl=en). This is the 2017 iteration of Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition. It's a blend of a their 15 yr OESK recipe, 13-year-old OESK and 12-year-old OESV. Apparently this is a low rye release for Four Roses but would be high rye most anywhere else. Anyways let's get to it.

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 108.6 proof (54.3 ABV)

**Color**: Copper

### Neat
**Nose**:  Very sweet just short cloying but in a "The Price is Right
 sort of way with notes of brown sugar, charred oak, baking spice and a bit of clove

**Taste**: Amazing mouthfeel and taste with thick brown sugar and oak notes balanced by rye spice

**Finish**: A long lovely linger that starts sweet and fades to a spicy tingle reminiscent of holiday spice with hints of something fruity


### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice mutes the oak a bit and brings the baking spice forward leading to an excellent balance of sweet and spicy

**Taste**: Very similar to neat but with slight more spice brought in and a pleasant cherry note in the background

**Finish**: A bit shorter than the neat finish with brown sugar and cherry sweetness fading into a spicy linger


## Conclusion
Wow! This was amazing especially with just a bit of ice. Unfortunately finding a bottle of this is basically impossible. Four Roses makes some amazing bourbon and I wish they would scale up production on these special editions! For me they are a favorite on par with BTAC,
