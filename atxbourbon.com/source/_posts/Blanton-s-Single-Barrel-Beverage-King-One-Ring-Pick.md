The folks at Beverage King in Connecticut were kind enough to sell me one of their Blanton's pick at retail so obviously I jumped on that. Harsha is a great guy and his ECBP pick was pretty great so I was very excited for this bottle. The Lord of the Rings one ring tater label didn't hurt either :)

## Blanton's Single Barrel Beverage King One Ring Pick

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 93

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet nose and front palate with vanilla honey buttercream frosting notes. Then a burst of spice and oak that lingesr alongside vanilla extract for a very long finish.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

## Conclusion

This is right up there with the Moonshine Blanton's pick for the best 93 proof modern Blanton's I've tasted. Buffalo Trace makes some great whiskey.

**TL;DR:** I'd drink more Blanton's if they all tasted like this!
