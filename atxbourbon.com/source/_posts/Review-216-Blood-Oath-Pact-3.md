Part 7 of the finished whiskey series is back to Blood Oath with my favorite Pact. Pact 3 is a blend of two rye bourbons, one finished in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels from Swanson Vineyard in Napa Valley. When I lived in California I developed a taste for their red wine so adding a few of those notes to bourbon sounds pretty appealing to me.

## Blood Oath Pact 3
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Price**: $99

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich and sweet with red wine, nutty, vanilla and oak notes,

**Taste**: Oak, caramel, red fruit, vanilla, faint nuttiness. Solid mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: Long, warm and sweet with more caramel, red fruit and oak notes. 

## Conclusion
I'll start by saying I'm glad I have a 3rd bottle of this since I killed the second one writing this review. This is definitely the high water mark for Blood Oath for me though the Pact 5 was getting close. I really enjoyed the red wine notes that the finish added to the nuttiness of the Heaven Hill profile. The mouthfeel was solid for the proof, the finish was great. I do wish this was higher proof but I can't blame them for their little body temperature gimmick.

The price on these is a bit high but it's the same as High West's A Midwinter Night's Dram and is also an NAS, sourced,  98.6 proof, finished whiskey so I guess it makes sense. I don't feel bad about buying MWND each year and the same applies here. I think Pact 3 is on par with the [my favorite recent batch of MWND, Act 6](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/11/21/Review-160-163-High-West-AMidwinter-Nights-Dram-Acts-2-5-6-and-7/).

At this point it's probably not worth tracking down another bottle of the dwindling supply of this release but I'll definitely be on the look out for Pact 6 which should hit in the next couple months.

**TL;DR:** Great whiskey, the red wine and nutty notes pair brilliantly
