Part 16 of the finished whiskey series takes a turn into new territory with a Belle Meade pick finished in XO Cognac casks. This pick is from [The Bourbon Enthusiast who had previously picked an excellent Magnus single barrel](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/12/19/Reviews-178-180-Joseph-Magnus-Single-Barrels-2019/). I like finished bourbon, cognac, Belle Meade and Bourbon Enthusiast so my hopes were pretty high for this pick. Let's see if it held up.

## Review #231 Belle Meade Select Cask XO Bourbon The Bourbon Enthusiast Selection
**Age**:  NAS

**Abv**: 115.1 proof

**Price**: $90

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet berries, rich oak and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: More sweet berries, cherry, vanilla, caramel, subtler oak notes.

**Finish**: Long warm finish with baking spices, oak and subtler sweet caramel.                        

## Conclusion
I was not disappointed. This was a great pick with just the right amount of influence from the finish. The cognac notes were very present without drowning out the MGP bourbon. The proof is in a great spot for me but it was very easy to drink without being thin or watery. Overall I was very happy with this pick and when I had a chance to grab a third bottle I jumped on it especially since these cask strength finished bourbons are moving to distillery only for the foreseeable future. 

As far as -gnac finished bourbon goes this isn't quite [Cigar Blend](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/cigar-blend/) level but it wasn't far off either and was a lot more affordable!

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Drinks well below its proof, Well balanced between the cognac notes and MGP notes.
