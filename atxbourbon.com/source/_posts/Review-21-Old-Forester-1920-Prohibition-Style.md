Old Forester 1920 was my first experience with a good high proof bourbon and definitely opened me up to that world. After reviewing a few of my favorite high proof picks it felt like a good time to come and see how the old boy held up. 

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 115 proof (57.5% ABV)

**Color**: A dark amber

### Neat
**Nose**: Lightly burnt caramel with just a touch of alcohol and smaller notes of oak and spice

**Taste**: Pretty hot with more caramel, oak and spice notes

**Finish**: Also hot with an emphasis on the sweeter notes from the taste

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice mellows the nose keeping caramel note front and center with the oak, spice and a new cherry note supporting

**Taste**: The heat is all gone leaving caramel and cherry goodness. On some sips I could pick out the oak but not others.

**Finish**: Medium length and sweet with more caramel and cherries

## Conclusion
I don't particularly care for this neat, it's too hot for me, but adding an ice cube completely remedies that. The caramel and cherry notes are lovely with the chilled whiskey though I do wish more of the spice survived. Overall I am still a fan though this has given way to other high proof expressions like [Stagg Jr](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/16/Review-15-Stagg-Jr/) and [1792 Full Proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/) as I've continued on my bourbon journey.
