This Old Weller Antique with a Texas sticker was popping up at independent liquor stores in Austin this summer and since OWA is one of my favorite daily drinkers, even after the price increase, I'm always happy to score a bottle of a store pick.

This particular Harlen Wheatley selection for Texas is a bit of a mystery. It hit a variety of independent retailers last year but no one was sure who it was originally for or why it was being split between shops. Thankfully my usual spot got some in and hooked me up with a bottle.

## Old Weller Antique 107 Texas Spring 2019 Barrel 22
**Age**: NAS years

**Abv**: 107 proof

**Price**: $55

### Neat
**Nose**: Cherry, caramel, vanilla and cinnamon notes

**Taste**: Simpler than the nose with mostly caramel and cherry notes. Great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with caramel, vanilla, baking spice and cinnamon notes. 

## Conclusion

It was very on profile for OWA with cherry, caramel and cinnamon notes throughout. It wasn't my favorite pick and I actually put it narrowly behind a standard bottle in a blind. It was still quite tasty though and worth the retail price.

I'm running perilously low on Weller picks after finishing this one. Hopefully more picks hit Austin soon!

**TL;DR:** Weaker OWA pick, very on profile, still good though
