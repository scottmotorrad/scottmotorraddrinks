## Willett Family Estate Single Barrel Rye Loch and Key Wish It

**Age**: 7 years

**Proof**: 119.4

**Barrel No**: 114

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet and herbal nose with vanilla cream and Italian herb notes. Rye spice, herbal liqueur, caramel and a bit of tropical fruit on the palate. The finish is long and spicy.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

**TL;DR:**Exactly what I expected and wanted from a WFE Rye
