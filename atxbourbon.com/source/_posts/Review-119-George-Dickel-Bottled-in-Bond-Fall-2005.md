George Dickel recently released a 13 year old bottled in bond expression at a very reasonable price and it hit Texas this week! I've been enjoying Barrell and Smooth Ambler's Dickel sourced releases and am a fan of bottled in bond so I had to pick one of these up.

## George Dickel Bottled in Bond Fall 2005
**Age**: 13 years

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Color**: A medium amber

**Price**: $40.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Chocolate milk powder, toasted marshmallow and a bit of mineral water

**Taste**: More chocolate, marshmallow and minerality with some warm spice and faint oak notes. Decent mouthfeel but thinner than I expected. 

**Finish**: Medium length finish where the age really shows with strong oak notes with supporting spice and chocolate.

## Conclusion
I liked this whiskey though it's not going to convert you to Dickel juice if you're not a fan and overall isn't anything crazy to write home about. 

It is very comparable to the new 13 year Smooth Ambler Old Scout Single Barrel Select so I decided to do a little side by side. Unfortunately all of my [first bottle of SAOS SiB Select](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/04/22/Review-109-Smooth-Ambler-Old-Scout-Single-Barrel-Select/) evaporated so I can't compare this whiskey directly with that one but I did pick up a second bottle in trade from a friend who doesn't like Dickel. It clocked in at a slightly lower 96.8 proof than the first one's 99 proof and wasn't quite as tasty. Compared to the 96.8 SAOS bottle the Dickel BiB was had a stronger nose, thinner mouthfeel, less spice, more oak on the finish and a bit more of that Dickel mineral/vitamin note. Overall I preferred both bottles of the SAOS SiB Select to this but not by a huge margin. 

**TL;DR:** If you're a Dickel fan on a budget this hits all the right Dickel notes at a great price but if you can swing the extra $24 I'd go with the Smooth Ambler.

On a side note some folks are concerned about the lack of age statement on the label; it's on the website and in their press materials. I think that's just for classic marketing bs so they can reduce the age of future releases without having to change the label but who knows.

### Quality
**6** - a good whiskey I'm still happy to drink

### Value based on what I paid
**Great** - A great deal, I'd buy it again
