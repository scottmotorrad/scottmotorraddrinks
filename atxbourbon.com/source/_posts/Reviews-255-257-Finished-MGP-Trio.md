For part 25 of 30 in the finished whiskey series were taking a look at samples of 3 pretty different finished MGP whiskies. From an MGP light whiskey finished in Pinot Noir casks by Bull Run to a crazy one off Boone County pick to the legendary batch 1 of Belle Meade Honey!

For this sample set I did a [blind tasting of all 3](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CDtyyGAH3BF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and then sat down to write more detailed notes.

## Reviews #255-257: Finished MGP Trio

### Bull Run 12 year Pinot Noir Finish
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: Unfortunately not sure

#### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet but also harsh with artificial sweetener(Splenda?), ethanol and fainter dark fruit notes.

**Taste**: Sweet dark fruit and caramel, vanilla, warm spice, a touch of cinnamon. Great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long cloyingly sweet finish with red fruit, honey, and a bit of oak.

**0 Stars** - **Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

### Boone County 10 Year Sauternes Finish Local Vine Pick
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 90.8 proof

#### Neat
**Nose**: White wine notes with honey and grape followed by vanilla and hints of wood

**Taste**: Sweet with more honey, apple, caramel, rich oak and grape notes. Decent mouthfeel, especially for the proof.

**Finish**: Long finish with baking spices and sweet honey

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

### Belle Meade Honey Cask
**Age**: 8-11 years

**Abv**: 113.6 proof

#### Neat
**Nose**: Honey, rich oak, brown sugar, vanilla, more honey.

**Taste**: Rich and sweet with honey, oak, caramel, warm spices.

**Finish**: Medium length with warm spices, honey, oak and caramel.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Conclusion

First off the Belle Meade Honey lived up to the hype! That was fantastic. If I could buy a bottle for an even semi reasonable price I would jump on it. The Boone County was also a surprise as I thought the low proof would really hold it back but it did not. The Boone County is a special release from back in 2017 and before this I didn't realize Boone County had ever done a finished bourbon. The Bull Run was a definitely a let down and I'm not that surprised as MGP light whiskey tends not to be my thing.

**TL;DR:** Belle Meade Honey > Boone County Sauternes >> Bull Run Pinot

I've finally figured out how I am going to wrap this series up. We've got 3 more review style posts, a post on home finishing and then something I am excited for as the series wrap up.
