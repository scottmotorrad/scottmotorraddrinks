After doing a few lower score reviews I needed to drink something I enjoy and have had a few conversations about 1792 lately so 1792 Full Proof it is. 1792 is a range from Bartons and this is their strongest normal bottling(unclear if any of the Full Proof single barrel selects are bottled at a higher proof). 

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 125 proof (62.5% ABV)

**Color**: A deeper gold

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich a sweet with notes of honey and oak and just a tingle of spice.

**Taste**: A medium consistency with deeper expressions of the notes from the nose. Rich oak, vanilla caramel and hints of spice

**Finish**: The vanilla and oak fade to a lingering spice with just a hint of a burn. Delicious.

### On a rock
**Nose**: All vanilla and caramel, nice but I miss the spice and oak from the neat nose

**Taste**: The oak is back complimenting the caramel and spice. The ice improves the mouth feel for me as well.

**Finish**: Cut a bit short but the same fading sweetness into spice and just the smallest burn.

## Conclusion
I'm a huge fan of this bourbon and was torn between 8 and 9. While it is excellent and the price to quality ratio is outstanding I feel like it needs a little something extra to push it up into the 9s. That said this is shockingly smooth for such a high proof but still has a great mouth feel and strong flavors. So far all 3 1792s I've tried (Small Batch and Single Barrel reviews incoming) have been great and I will be trying to track down more of their line to round out the series.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
