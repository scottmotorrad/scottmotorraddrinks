Part 3 of the finished whiskey series takes us to my current favorite line of finished whiskey: [Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/10/06/Review-150-Joseph-Magnus-Cigar-Blend-Batch-12/). I know u/prepreludesh would be disappointed if I didn't have a Cigar Blend early on in this series (and maybe one or two more later on) so here we are with the oldest batch I have #8.

Cigar Blend is a blend of middling to old MGP bourbon, including some that is finished in Cognac and Sherry casks, which is then finished in an Armagnac cask to give it a robust finish that holds up to a cigar pairing.

## Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Batch 8
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 112.82 proof

**Price**: $225 ($169.99 MSRP)

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich and sweet with leather, vanilla and brown sugar notes backed by a subtler spice.

**Taste**: Deeply complex with layers of sweet, rich and spicy notes including butterscotch, vanilla, leather, charred oak and baking spices as well as rye spice. Thick and velvety mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Extremely long slightly dry finish with warm spices, sweet vanilla and faint leather and oak 

### With a Cigar

**Cigar**: Alec Bradley Magic Toast

**Nose**: Strong enough that I can still smell the leather and sweetness over the cigar smoke

**Taste**: Definitely muted by the cigar but the sweet and spicy combo is still there as is the mouthfeel.

**Finish**: This is the best part as you keep tasting the long finish as you draw on the cigar


## Conclusion

This wasn't my favorite batch of Cigar Blend but it was still excellent and very much fulfilled the goal of pairing with a cigar. It has all the upside of well aged MGP with some additional notes from the Armagnac and a much longer finish than I get with a lot of 10-12 year MGP. It was a little spicy and dry for my taste especially compared to batches 12, 14 and 18. I paid over retail for this batch and wouldn't do it again though.

**TL;DR:** Weakest Cigar Blend of the batches I have, still fantastic. One of the longest finishes I've had on a bourbon.


[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'd like to have at home

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
