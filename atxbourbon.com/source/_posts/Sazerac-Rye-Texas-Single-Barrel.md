A while back these State of Texas Sazerac single barrels started popping up around Austin so I made sure to grab one. I mostly used this as a cocktail base but also drank it neat a few times. Now that the bottle is almost empty it's time for a review!

## Sazerac Rye Texas Single Barrel

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet, herbal and spicy but thin mouthfeel and short finish.

**Stars**: **1 Star** 

## Conclusion

I drank most of this as a mixer but did enjoy some neat as well. Overall it was pleasant but not something I reach for to sip neat. That said the herbal notes came through nicely in cocktails though which made it a great spirit base and it was a go to for rye old fashioneds, sazeracs and old pals. I also tried it side by side with Thomas H Handy Sazerac and while you could tell they similarities there was no competition even when proofing the Handy down.

**TL;DR:** Good for the price, great for cocktails.
