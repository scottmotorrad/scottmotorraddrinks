I got lucky at a Moonshine raffle event a while back and won one of their Weller Full Proof picks from the 1st barrel. Unfortunately I struck out on the raffle for the second barrel so my dreams of doing a side by side review have been dashed. That coupled with the perilously low level of this bottle mean it's finally time to write a review and then kill it!

## Weller Full Proof Moonshine Single Barrel Select

**Age**: NAS - I believe this one is right around 8

**Proof**: 114

### Neat

**Nose**: Potent nose with spice, oak and cinnamon balanced by sweet vanilla.

**Taste**: Cinnamon candy, baking spices, butterscotch and a bit of cherry. Great mouthfeel!

**Finish**: Long, warm finish with fading butterscotch then lingering oak and cinnamon.

## Conclusion

First off this is a great bottle of whiskey and I am very thankful to have gotten a bottle. It's a little on the spicy side which isn't bad but it's not my favorite Weller profile as I am looking for something sweeter from a wheater. If I was going to single in on a Weller Full Proof pick to hunt down there are probably picks I'd place above this on that list (such as the second Moonshine Weller Full Proof!). On the other hand I would happily buy another one of these or enter a raffle for one.

Again, this was a great bottle and I liked it quite a bit the Weller Full Proof pick world just has a lot of tough competition :)

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Another great Moonshine pick but not my favorite Weller pick they've done
