For review #101 and part four of the five part Wild Turkey series we are drinking Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades batch #2. This is a blend of 10 to 20 year old Wild Turkey.

## Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades
**Age**: a blend of 10 to 20 year bourbons

**Abv**: 104 proof

**Color**: A dark amber 

**Price**: $110 on sale usually $150

### Neat
**Nose**: A excellent balance of vanilla, caramel and oak notes with a touch of spice.

**Taste**: Rich and sweet with cherry, caramel, vanilla notes alongside a touch of oak and spice alongside an excellent, viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length with cherry notes fading to warm spice and vanilla.

## Conclusion
Somewhat unsurprisingly, given the ages of everything, this was the darkest of the bunch. It also had the best mouthfeel, was the sweetest and easiest to drink. This was a big step up from [the 101](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/26/Review-97-Wild-Turkey-101/), [Rare Breed](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/28/Review-98-Wild-Turkey-Rare-Breed/) and [Kentucky Spirit](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/04/02/Review-100-Wild-Turkey-Kentucky-Spirit/) and was pretty close to the [Moonshine Cheesy Gold Foil pick](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/19/Reviews-76-77-Russel-s-Reserve-Single-Barrel-Showdown-Moonshine-vs-Tejas/). The only thing holding this back was the shorter finish than the CGF. Somewhat interestingly both this and CGF got less oaky from nose to finish.

Overall I am a big fan of this dram and will be buying another bottle next time it is on sale.

### Quality
**8** - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

### Value based on what I paid
**Fair** - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
