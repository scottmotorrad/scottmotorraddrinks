{% asset_img image.jpg "1792 Ridgemont Reserve"%}

Continuing the 1792 lineup with another one of their rarer expressions today is the Ridgemont Reserve. Older bottlings of this carried an 8 year age statement but as with some many lines these days age statements are going the way of the dodo. So let's get to it!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 93.7 proof (46.85 ABV)

**Color**: A dark copper, at least a shade darker that the rest of the 1792s thus far

### Neat
**Nose**: Delicious rye spice and strong oak notes are prevalent with a bit of the caramel I've come to expect from most 1792s in the background and just a hint of something fruity

**Taste**: Strong vanilla and caramel notes with oak still present though more muted than the nose.The rye from the nose is suspiciously absent. The mouthfeel was nice but nothing special.

**Finish**: The rye comes back in this medium length well balanced finish

### On a rock
**Nose**: The rye is muted but still present with the caramel taking its place while the oak holds steady

**Taste**: The vanilla and oak notes dominate the palate on ice though the caramel note is still fairly prominent 

**Finish**: The rye is basically gone leaving a sort of generic sweet finish

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion
Another good whiskey from 1792 though this one fell a little short for me compared to the 225th and the Full Proof especially since it held up to ice so poorly. I imagine a 'Full Proof" variant of this would be excellent though. I really enjoyed the strong rye notes on the neat nose and am hoping the High Rye continues to deliver on this front.
