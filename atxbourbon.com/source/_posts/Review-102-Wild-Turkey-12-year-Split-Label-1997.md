There's been a lot of hype around dusty Wild Turkey lately and I was curious to see if it was really that different from the new stuff and this Wild Turkey series seemed like the perfect time to do it so for the fifth and final entry I'm reviewing a sample of 1997 Wild Turkey 101 12 year "split label" I got from a local bourbon collector.

## Wild Turkey 101 12 Year 1997
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 101 proof

**Color**: A dark amber with a touch of red

### Neat
**Nose**: Floral and maple notes are backed by old leather and rich tobacco.

**Taste**: More tobacco, maple and floral notes with new  oak and warm spice notes as well.

**Finish**: Medium to long length with vanilla, tobacco and maple notes.


## Conclusion
First off this tasted completely different from any of the modern Turkeys I've had. I can understand how folks that learned to love these flavors are disappointed by the shift in flavor profile. That said I wasn't a big fan. I don't usually like maple, leather or tobacco notes in bourbon and this dram leaned in on all three of those. It had a shorter finish than the Decades and the Moonshine CGF pick and a lackluster mouthfeel. I preferred all of the modern expressions, even 101 and Kentucky Spirit, to this dram and given the crazy prices this commands I'll never being getting a bottle. Still I wouldn't say no if someone else was pouring :)

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

Overall this series was a ton of fun and really opened my eyes to how good 101 and Rare Breed are for the money as well as reinforcing my belief that Russel's Reserve store picks can be some of the best buys in bourbon. The Moonshine Russell's Reserve Cheesy Gold Foil pick is still my favorite Turkey but the Decades was outstanding as well. I was very happy to be cured of any desire to splurge for a bottle of dusty Turkey.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
