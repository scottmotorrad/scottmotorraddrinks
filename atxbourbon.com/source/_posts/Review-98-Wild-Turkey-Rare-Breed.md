This the second review in a five part verticalish series on Wild Turkey bourbon comparing 5 of their relatively recent releases and one dusty against each other and my favorite Wild Turkey juice of all time: [Moonshine Grill's Russell's Reserve pick](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/19/Reviews-76-77-Russel-s-Reserve-Single-Barrel-Showdown-Moonshine-vs-Tejas/).

We're moving up from [Wild Turkey 101](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/26/Review-97-Wild-Turkey-101/) to Rare Breed.

## Wild Turkey Rare Breed
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 116.8 proof

**Color**: A medium amber 

**Price**: $42.99

**Laser Code**: LL/GH020357

### Neat
**Nose**: Warm, sweet and inviting with brown sugar, vanilla and baking spice notes.

**Taste**: Sweet brown sugar and vanilla notes are balanced against warm baking spice and rye. Decent mouthfeel but a little thinner than I expected from the proof.

**Finish**: Long dry finish with lingering baking spice notes.

## Conclusion
Somehow this was both higher proof, more flavorful and less harsh than the 101 which made it an excellent step up in quality though it comes with a similar step up in price. The Rare Breed didn't quite measure up the the Moonshine "Cheesy Gold Foil" which had all the same brown sugar and warm spicy goodness but also had a very nice oak note bringing welcome additional complexity. While this dram wasn't my favorite of the bunch it certainly wins when you factor in price and availability.

Overall this is great bourbon at a good price and is a great into to barrel proof bourbons for folks looking to get into them. All in all this is a whiskey that does everything right but doesn't do something special to put it over into the 9 or 10 range for me.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid neat and/or would happily use as a mixer

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - not drinking this neat but it's fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch, but preferably not drinking it

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
