{% asset_img image.jpg "Heaven hill Tasting Experience"%}

After the r/bourbon community review of Evan Williams Black Label I realized I hadn't tried much of Heaven Hill's bourbon so rectify that I went out and picked up the Heaven Hill Distillery American Whiskey Tasting Experience. It's a little box set with 5 100mL bottles of different whiskies, 3 bourbons, a rye and a wheat whiskey. Tonight I'm reviewing the 3 bourbons; I don't think I can do 5 tastings in one sitting haha. The bourbons are Larceny, Evan Williams Single Barrel and Elijah Craig Small Batch.

## Larceny
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 92 proof (46% ABV)

**Color**: A medium amber, very similar to Evan Williams Black Label and the other two in this set 

### Neat
**Nose**: Heavy notes of butterscotch, almost cloying but just on the right side of too sweet.

**Taste**: Smooth and butterscotchy sweet, still pretty one note though

**Finish**: Middling length and still smooth and sweet

### On a rock
**Nose**: Lighter notes of butterscotch 

**Taste**: The ice greatly improves the mouthfeel and while the notes remain sweet it doesn't just taste like butterscotch anymore but I couldn't quite place the second sweet note.

**Finish**: A little shorter and a sort of nutty or toffee note comes in.

## Evan Williams Single Barrel
**Age**: 7-8 years according to the packaging

**Abv**: 86.6 proof (43.3% ABV)

**Color**: Also a medium amber

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with primarily vanilla and oak notes and just a touch of alcohol

**Taste**: Underwhelming with mostly just an oak note and a very thin mouthfeel

**Finish**: A long finish where the oak fades and a mild caramel lingers

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice quenches anything other than the oak note. 

**Taste**: Significantly improved by the ice. Sweet honey notes come forward to compliment the oak but remains a little thin

**Finish**: A nice spice note lingers with the sweetness from the neat finish. Definitely better.   

## Elijah Craig Small Batch
**Age**: 8-12 years according to the packaging

**Abv**: 94 proof (47% ABV)

**Color**: Also a medium amber

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet vanillia, oak and baking spice in that order, very nice

**Taste**: The vanilla is no where to be found as the oak dominates the taste and the spice notes compliment it. The mouthfeel is nice but not outstanding.

**Finish**: Middling length finish where the oak and spice give way to the vanilla from the nose

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice had very little impact on the nose, if anything the oak stands out a bit more and the vanilla relaxes a bit. 

**Taste**: All oak notes but the mouth feel is improved by the ice

**Finish**: I was pleasantly surprised that the ice didn't noticeably shorten the finish and the oak and spice notes blended better with the vanilla throughout the finish.

## Conclusion
This tasting flight was definitely an adventure. To start with I was disappointed with the Larceny, it wasn't bad but I'd prefer any of the Weller lineup for a wheater. I honestly surprised by how good the Evan Williams Single Barrel was. I'd love to try a barrel proof version of this. The Elijah Craig Small Batch was exactly what I expected, having had it before haha, it's always enjoyable though once you've had the barrel proof the small batch is a little underwhelming.

**Larceny - 6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid 

**Evan Williams Single Barrel - 7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar

**Elijah Craig Small Batch - 7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
