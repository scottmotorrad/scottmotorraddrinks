During my recent exploration of the new, single barrel offerings from Jack Daniel's Oak Liquor Cabinet happened to get in store of the Select; naturally I couldn't wait to do a side by side comparison of the store pick and a regular bottle. Without further ado let's get to the review

## Single Barrel Select #17-3241
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 94 proof

**Color**: A red tinged amber 

**Price**: $43.99

### Neat
**Nose**: A balance nose with sweet bananas, caramel, warm spice and oak

**Taste**: Weaker notes than the nose with mostly caramel and oak notes. Nice mouthfeel, viscous for being sub 100 proof. 

**Finish**: The flavors pick back up in the medium length finish with vanilla, spice and oak notes

### On a rock
**Nose**: Muted by the ice but still sweet with predominantly caramel notes

**Taste**: Caramel and vanilla

**Finish**: Shorter but not short, no spice, nice vanilla

## OLC Pick Barrel #17-0657
**Age**: 5 years

**Abv**: 94 proof

**Color**: A shade lighter than the normal offering

**Price**: $47.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with caramel, banana, vanilla and oak notes but not nearly as much spice

**Taste**: All bananas and oak Mouth felt a bit thinner than the normal offering

**Finish**: Significantly longer finish with strong sweet bananas, vanilla and oak alongside a touch of warm spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: Also a bit muted by the ice but with clear banana and caramel notes

**Taste**: The taste held up better to the ice with that banana note shining through 

**Finish**: The finish is again more powerful than the normal offering with more banana and oak 

## Conclusion
Leaning in on the signature JD banana notes and the better finish put the OLC pick up a notch over the Select for me but not enough to get to an 8. These bottles don't live up to the very high bar the [Heritage Barrel](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/01/31/Review-68-Jack-Daniel-s-Heritage-Barrel-18-6357/) set for me but as a significant step up over previous JD releases. I could see myself occasionally grabbing one of these bottles as an alternative to a Four Roses SiB or [OF 1920](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/26/Review-21-Old-Forester-1920-Prohibition-Style/) as change up. 

### Single Barrel Select #17-3241
**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

### OLC Pick Barrel #17-0657
**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
