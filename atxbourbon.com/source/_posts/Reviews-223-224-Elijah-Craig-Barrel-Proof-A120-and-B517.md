I recently got a sample of Heaven Hill's latest Elijah Craig Barrel Proof batch A120 and meant to blind it against my favorite recent batch B519 but realized that I had killed that bottle a while back without saving a sample or reviewing it. So I dug around and found an old B517(another batch I really enjoyed) and used that instead. The blind tasting video is on [Instagram here](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-74eSxHMXL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). After that I sat down to write more detailed tasting notes.

## Review #223 Elijah Craig Barrel Proof A120
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 136.6 proof

**Price**: $60

### Neat
**Nose**: Nose hair singeing heat with clear ethanol then subtler caramel and oak notes.

**Taste**: Hot with rye spice, cinnamon, caramel and oak notes.

**Finish**: Medium length hot finish with some cinnamon notes.

[**5**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/5/) - a whiskey with notable strengths but also held back by some flaws

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money

## Review #223 Elijah Craig Barrel Proof B517
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 124.2 proof

**Price**: $60

### Neat
**Nose**: Slightly harsh with a bit of ethanol but with nicer vanilla and oak notes too.

**Taste**: Bold with rich oak, nuts, caramel and spices. Great mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: Long and warm with baking spices, vanilla and subtler oak notes. 

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'd like to have at home

[**Great**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/great-value/) - A great deal, I'd buy it again

## Conclusion

The A120 was just too hot for me to really enjoy neat and while it was good on a rock the tasting notes would have been even more generic than these were. This review also made me realize I've also gotten to the point where I am not impressed if something is good on the rock anymore, especially if it is more than ~$30 since something WT101 is delicious on ice and I can buy that whenever I want and for something higher proof, age stated and nuttier then Knob Creek Single Barrel fits the bill without any of the hassle of getting an ECBP while saving a few bucks too.

C919 and A120 have cemented ECBP as a try before you buy for me and thankfully finding it at a bar around here or getting a sample is pretty easy. I'll continue to love the more drinkable batches and let the heat monsters stay on the shelf for someone else who will appreciate them.

**TL;DR:** B517 > A120. A120 was too hot neat; it was quite good on a rock though.
