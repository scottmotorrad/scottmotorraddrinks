This is the first in a 3 part series comparing some of Glenfiddich's mid range solera vat single malts: the [Select Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/04/Review-83-Glenfiddich-Select-Cask/), the [Reserve Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/12/Review-89-Glenfiddich-Reserve-Cask/) and the [15 year Solera Reserve](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/07/Review-86-Glenfiddich-15-Solera-Reserve/). I tasted all 3 of them together but not blindly.

We're starting with the Select Cask which is a combination of European, bourbon and red wine casks. This is a duty free exclusive that I picked up on my way back from Mexico.

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A light, pale gold 

**Price**: $50

### Neat
**Nose**: Bright sweet notes of floral honey, citrus peel, malt and a vanilla note when a couple drops of water were added

**Taste**: Neat it was significantly muted from the nose with more honey and a bit of citrus but not much else thankfully a couple drops of water brought out a vanilla note and a touch of spice. Unfortunately thin mouthfeel though even with the water.

**Finish**: Short and simple with vanilla and honey notes.

## Conclusion
The European oak and bourbon cask influences were clear; I didn't get any notes I associate with red wine casks though. Overall this was a decent pour but nothing really stood out either. Given the limited availability, duty free only, and the price I'd just stick with the 14 year bourbon cask or spring for the 15 year.

[**7**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/7/) - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
