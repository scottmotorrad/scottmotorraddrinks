This is the first in a 3 part series comparing some of Glenfiddich's mid range solera vat single malts: the [Select Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/04/Review-83-Glenfiddich-Select-Cask/), the [Reserve Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/12/Review-89-Glenfiddich-Reserve-Cask/) and the [15 year Solera Reserve](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/07/Review-86-Glenfiddich-15-Solera-Reserve/). I tasted all 3 of them together but not blindly.

We're starting with the Select Cask which is a combination of European, bourbon and red wine casks. This is a duty free exclusive that I picked up on my way back from Mexico.

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A light, pale gold 

**Price**: $50

### Neat
**Nose**: Bright sweet notes of floral honey, citrus peel, malt and a vanilla note when a couple drops of water were added

**Taste**: Neat it was significantly muted from the nose with more honey and a bit of citrus but not much else thankfully a couple drops of water brought out a vanilla note and a touch of spice. Unfortunately thin mouthfeel though even with the water.

**Finish**: Short and simple with vanilla and honey notes.

## Conclusion
The European oak and bourbon cask influences were clear; I didn't get any notes I associate with red wine casks though. Overall this was a decent pour but nothing really stood out either. Given the limited availability, duty free only, and the price I'd just stick with the 14 year bourbon cask or spring for the 15 year.

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

You can also follow me on [Instagram(@atxbourbon)](https://www.instagram.com/atxbourbon/) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottmotorraddrinks/) to keep up with these reviews and my other whiskey-centric adventures.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
