I had the great fortune of being able to visit Scotland during the Spirit of Speyside festival this year as part of my anniversary trip. Naturally I had to go to my favorite distillery, Glenfiddich, unfortunately I didn't get until the day after they released their festival bottle but by a stroke of luck I was still able to grab one! This year's expression was fully matured in Port Pipes which is a first for Glenfiddich. It was hard not to crack it while I was still in the UK but I managed to wait to get back to the states and then immediately opened it. So now that I've had a few pours let's see how it stacks up!

## Glenfiddich Spirit of Speyside 2019
**Age**: 15 years

**Abv**: 117 proof

**Color**: A medium amber with a red tint 

**Price**: 200 GBP

### Neat
**Nose**: Honey, sweet cherries and faint floral notes.  

**Taste**: More honey and cherries with a little bit of oak and spice. Thick and luscious mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long, warm sweet cherry pie.

## Conclusion
This was delicious! I really enjoyed the strong Port influence, the mouthfeel and all the flavor that comes from the high proof. I had the chance to try several other cask strength Glenfiddich expressions while I was there and now I am very sad they aren't readily available here in the States. 

I do think with a few more years of aging this would have been a perfect 10 but I still really enjoyed it and am going to try and savor the rest of the bottle. I have more souvenir bottles to work through and review in the coming weeks!

### Quality
**9** - a favorite Iâ€™d like to keep on my shelf 

### Value
**Fair** - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
