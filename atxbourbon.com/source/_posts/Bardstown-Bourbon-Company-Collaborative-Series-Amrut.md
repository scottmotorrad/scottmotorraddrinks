Thanks to the folks at Bardstown for the samples! No star rating since I didn't buy these.

## Bardstown Bourbon Company Collaborative Series Amrut

**Blend Components**: 43% 9 year rye/20% 8 year rye/17% 14 year bourbon/15% 10 year bourbon/5% 11 year bourbon

**Proof**: 110

**Notes**: Leads with plenty of spice with cinnamon, rye spice and something else I can't quite place (they said ginger). The pear and honey from the single malt come through nicely on the mid palate. Some dark fruit, caramel and a slight nuttiness as well. Long warm finish with more spice, some oak and a bit of sweetness.

## Amrut Indian Single Malt Whisky 2023

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 92

**Notes**: Pear, honey, faint spice, sublte oak that is more present on the finish.

**TL;DR:** Another great collaboration release from Bardstown! Definitely going to grab a bottle of this one if/when they hit Texas.
