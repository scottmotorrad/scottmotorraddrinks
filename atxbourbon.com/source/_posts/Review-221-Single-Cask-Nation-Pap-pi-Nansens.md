Single Cask Nation recently had a raffle for their new Tennessee bourbon and someone in a local group won. They could buy two bottles but only wanted one so they pawned the second one off on me to save on shipping. Single Cask Nation claimed that their Dickel pick was not the usual Dickel flavor profile but I was pretty skeptical of that claim so let's see how this tastes!

[I blind tasted this against George Dickel Bottled in Bond, a Barrell pick and an SAOS Dickel pick on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-nOYH1n49n/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and then sat down to write up the tasting notes.

## Single Cask Nation Pap'pi Nansens
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 103.1 proof

**Price**: $100 shipped

### Neat
**Nose**: Chocolate and Dickel mineral/vitamin notes dominate the nose.

**Taste**: More chocolate and minerality from the nose joined by vanilla, rich oak and faint spice notes. Decent mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: Medium length finish with more oak, vanilla and Dickel.

## Conclusion

Well that was underwhelming. Honestly I thought it was pretty on par with [Dickel BiB](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/06/13/Review-119-George-Dickel-Bottled-in-Bond-Fall-2005/) and at 3 times the price that's going to be a no from me. I think the Barrell and SAOS picks were noticeably better and they are cheaper! I'll enjoy the rest of this bottle but it's further evidence that there aren't these magical unicorn Dickel barrels that command a premium price.

**TL;DR:** Mmm Dickel


[**6**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/6/) - a good whiskey I'm still happy to drink

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
