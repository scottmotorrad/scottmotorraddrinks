The great Rarebird101 [once commented on a post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/ei6bkd/atxbourbon_2019_whiskey_awards/fcnu0jn/) saying that my favorite Wild Turkey to date, the [Moonshine Russell's Reserve Cheesy Gold pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/askgbc/reviews_7677_russels_reserve_single_barrel/eh0az7y/), while great wasn't as impressive when you put it up against some other really top tier Wild Turkey. I recently came into possession of the Single Cask Nation Wild Turkey 10 year, [which I think qualifies as a top tier bottle](https://rarebird101.com/rb-101-top-10/), so naturally it was time for a blind. I also traded for a sample of the 2002 Russell's Reserve(review forthcoming) and threw in a random Russell's pick for control. 


The [blind tasting video is on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAJDCmInABH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and I sat down the next evening to write more detailed tasting notes.

## Review #230 Single Cask Nation Wild Turkey 10 Year
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 123.6 proof

**Price**: Hahaha

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweeter than I expected with honey, vanilla and some cherry notes and only faint spice.

**Taste**: Syrupy caramel, rich oak, rye spice, brown sugar, tobacco, faint nutty notes and that Wild Turkey funk. Really nice, viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long warm and sweet with brown sugar, baking spice, caramel and cinnamon notes.

## Conclusion
That was fantastic. Right up there with Kentucky Legend for the best Wild Turkey I've had. The tobacco and nutty notes aren't something I typically get from Turkey and I really enjoyed them. The finish was also fantastic. The nose was good but nothing special and I actually thought the RR2002 and Moonshine RR pick had better noses. Otherwise this outclassed both of those and I will say I agree with rarebird now :)

On another note I've pretty much explored the breadth of modern Wild Turkey and even taken a few ventures into dusty land but I just don't think Turkey goes to 10 for me the same way Buffalo Trace, Four Roses and MGP can but that's ok and as long as Russell's Reserve picks are ~$60 I won't stop buying them!

**TL;DR:** Fantastic Wild Turkey, right up there with [Donut](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/07/25/Review-130-Wild-Turkey-Kentucky-Legend/)
