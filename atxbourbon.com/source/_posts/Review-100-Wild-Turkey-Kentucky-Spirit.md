This the third review in a five part verticalish series on Wild Turkey bourbon comparing 5 of their relatively recent releases and one dusty against each other and my favorite Wild Turkey juice of all time: [Moonshine Grill's Russell's Reserve pick](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/19/Reviews-76-77-Russel-s-Reserve-Single-Barrel-Showdown-Moonshine-vs-Tejas/).

We're moving up from [Wild Turkey 101](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/26/Review-97-Wild-Turkey-101/) and [Rare Breed](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/28/Review-98-Wild-Turkey-Rare-Breed/) to Kentucky Spirit and using my other dog as the model this time.

## Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 101 proof

**Color**: A medium amber 

**Price**: $53.99

**Warehouse**: G rick number 6

**Barrel**: #3268

**Laser Code**: LL\E1020002

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and more delicate than I was expecting with floral honey and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: Again sweet and almost fruity with honey and vanilla notes throughout and a bit nuttiness at the end.

**Finish**: It leaves a lingering floral sweetness that is somewhat different for a whiskey finish.


## Conclusion
This wasn't my favorite. It was a very different taste profile compared to the 101 and Rare Breed which are more to my liking. That said it was very easy to drink for a 101 proofer with no harshness whatsoever and the honey and floral notes were nice. It was neck and neck between this and the 101 but in the end the 101 won by a nose. The Rare Breed and the Moonshine CGF handily beat this in the taste test. Overall it was a good bourbon and if you aren't a big fan of Wild Turkey you might prefer this to their usual suspects. 

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
