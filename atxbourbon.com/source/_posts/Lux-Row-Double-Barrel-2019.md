I picked this bottle of Lux Row Double Barrel up at the distillery over 2 years ago and am finally getting around to reviewing it. I've gone back to it from time to time and included it in [blind tasting flights](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6B2aCznGRY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) but it's never impressed me and I don't find myself reaching for the bottle. That said I've never found it to be bad just underwhelming in a flight so I'm going to try it again by itself and see if I can appreciate it a little more.

## Lux Row Double Barrel 2019

**Age**: 12 years

**Proof**: 118.4

**Price**: 150

**Barrels**: 5154523 and 5154524

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet caramel, rich oak, subtler fruit and nuts with just a hint of ethanol.

**Taste**: A big rush of caramel and baking spice with oak and red fruit toward the end. Decent but unremarkable mouthfeel. Hot for the proof.

**Finish**: Long, warm, slightly dry finish with cinnamon, baking spice, oak and vanilla notes.

## Conclusion

There were some great flavors in here but I feel like this drinks hotter than I would have expected for the 118.4 proof and didn't wow me. While there are tasting notes I typically really like (ie caramel, red fruit, nuts) they just didn't come together the way I wanted. The most telling thing is that it's taken ~2.5 years to drink through the bottle and I have no desire to track down a second one. I'd gladly take one of my preferred batches of ECBP over this and in the same price range Bardstown Discovery Series is a better buy. I know a lot of folks loved this one and I think I can see why but it wasn't my favorite.

As an aside I really liked this one the rocks but again I'd just as easily enjoy an ECBP that way for ~half the price. The ice tamed the heat and seeme dot make the flavors come together better for me.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

**TL;DR:** Enjoyable but not worth the high price and scarcity
