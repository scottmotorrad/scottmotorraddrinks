Still working my way through my Heaven Hill tasting kit. This was the only whiskey in there I had never heard of and I had no idea what to expect. I typically enjoy wheated bourbon but I'd never had a wheat whiskey before. Hopefully it holds up!

## Review
**Age**: 7 years

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Color**: A medium amber

### Neat
**Nose**: An interesting nose with a note that reminds me of buttered whole wheat bread with a touch of honey

**Taste**: The flavor is hard to place on this one, more wheat and sweet?

**Finish**: Short and semi sweet with a bit of harshness 

### On a rock
**Nose**: Sweeter than the neat nose like honey and wheat bread

**Taste**: A touch of bitterness among the sweet and wheaty notes. Something like bread with a sweetened tart berry jam

**Finish**: Warm and sweet, the best part of this one for sure

## Conclusion
Well I definitely need to taste more wheat whiskies, I was terrible at this haha. Overall it was fine but relatively underwhelming. If this dram is an indication of how whet whiskies are in general then I can see why they aren't as popular as corn and rye.

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
