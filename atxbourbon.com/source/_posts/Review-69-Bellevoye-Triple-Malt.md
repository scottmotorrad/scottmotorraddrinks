I attended a Whiskies of the World event last year and tried some rather good French whisky(Brenne) so I went to Total Wine to pick up some French whisky and ended up with Bellevoye Triple Malt. So let's see how it stacks up.

## Review
**Age**: NAS but 3-8 years

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Color**: A light, pale gold 

**Price**: $34.99

### Neat
**Nose**: An odd mix of fresh cut lumber, malt and a touch of artificial sweeteners and something herbal 

**Taste**: Thankfully better than the nose with notes I'd expect from a young single malt. Malt, honey, vanilla and touch of acetone. The thin mouthfeel wasn't surprising given the low proof.

**Finish**: Short and weird, I couldn't place the note but it was harsh I didn't care for it

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice mellows the nose out nicely to an inoffensive honey and malt with just a touch of fresh wood

**Taste**: Very similar to the neat notes with more malt and honey though the vanilla and acetone are absent

**Finish**: Unfortunately the ice didn't help with the harsh, short finish 

## Conclusion
To say the least this was disappointing, especially in the nose and finish though there were a few decent notes in there. I'm wondering if an older variation of this would actually be good? I did not care for this one so I ended up bringing it to a work happy hour just before I left the team :) That said it was fine as a mixer for a whisky and Coke. 

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
