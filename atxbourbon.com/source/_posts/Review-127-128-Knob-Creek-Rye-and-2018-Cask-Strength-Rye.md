For the third and final entry in the Knob Creek series I'll be tasting two of their rye options: the standard 100 proof Rye and the 2018 Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye, which was one of [the Whiskey Advocate Top 20 for 2018](http://whiskyadvocate.com/top20/2018/) which I am [vaguely trying to taste and review all of this year](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/whiskey-advocate-top-20-2018/). To set expectations I traditionally haven't been a fan of Knob Creek ryes and am definitely more of a bourbon guy overall.

## Knob Creek Straight Rye Whiskey
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Color**: Light amber

**Price**: $24.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Slightly harsh with bold spices and herbal notes backed by a little bit of cherry 

**Taste**: Spicy but balanced with some vanilla and a little oak. Nice mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length with rye spice and a touch of oak.

## Knob Creek 2018 Limited Edition Cask Strength Rye
**Age**: NAS (barreled in 2009 so 8-9 years old)

**Abv**: 119.6 proof

**Color**: Dark amber

**Price**: $74.99

**Other**: Warehouse A

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet, especially for a rye, with honey and rye spice backed by faint herbal notes

**Taste**: Spicy, herbal and hot with rye spice, pepper and dill. Not nearly as balanced as the nose. Very nice and viscous mouthfeel though.

**Finish**: Long, hot and herbal with rye spice and dill notes.


## Conclusion

The regular KC rye is fine, a little hot and a bit on the spicy but also had some good characteristics with the herbal notes and the mouthfeel. In a world with [the great and cheaper Old Forester Rye and the power house Willet 4 Year](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/07/Reviews-70-71-Old-Forester-Rye-Whisky-and-Willet-Family-Estate-4-Year-114-4-Proof/) for something nicer I can't see myself buying this bottle again.

The 2018 Limited Edition Cask Strength Rye was way too hot and the dill note wasn't for me. The nose and mouthfeel were great though. A little ice helped the heat but the spicy and dill notes were still a turnoff for me. Oddly the LE doesn't say straight rye whiskey on the bottle. I'm not sure what's up with that. I'm glad I was able to trade the rest of this away for a Barrell store pick instead from a fellow bourbon drinker who didn't care for the Dickel notes in the Barrell. I'm really surprised that this was picked as one of the best ryes of the year by Whiskey Advocate.

Overall I am going to stick with Knob Creek's excellent bourbon line up and leave their ryes for other folks!
