Sagamore Spirits is a Maryland distillery who primarily sources from MGP and then dilutes with their own limestone filtered water. They have a couple different rye recipes and this pick is a combination of 90% of their high rye mashbill and 10% of their low rye mashbill.

## Sagamore Spirits Rye Oak Liquor Cabinet and Austin Bourbon Hunters
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 95 proof

**Color**: A medium amber

**Price**: $43.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Herbal and cherry notes dominate the nose

**Taste**: A strong rye spice note compliments the herbal and cherry notes from the nose. Solid mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: A little short with warm rye spice and sweet herbs

### On a rock
**Nose**: The cherry notes are faint but still there while the herbal notes continue to dominate.

**Taste**: Herbals with hints of cherry and warm rye spice.

**Finish**: Very similar to the neat finish. Maybe a touch shorter

## Conclusion
A very nice take on MGP rye that is good both neat and on the rocks if a touch low in proof. It's quite herbal without strong dill notes from some MGP distillate, has a nice fruity cherry note and strong but not overpowering rye spice. Not quite at the level of High West Rendezvous but pretty close and a good bit cheaper. 

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options
