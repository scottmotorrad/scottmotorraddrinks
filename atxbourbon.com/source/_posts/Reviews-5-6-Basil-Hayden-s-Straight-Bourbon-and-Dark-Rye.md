## Narrative
I've mostly been writing reviews of whiskey that I love so far so I thought I'd try my hand at some reviews with a lower score. I tend to have a bottle of Basil Hayden's Straight Bourbon on hand and my wife bought me a bottle of their Dark Rye because I like ryes and she recognized the bottle. The straigh bourbon is of course a straight bourbon but the Dark Rye is some sort of Dr Moreau combination of rye, canadian and port.

## Straight Bourbon

**Abv**: 80 proof (40% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

## Review

**Color**: A lighter golden color

### Neat

**Nose**: Weak nose, slightly sweet with a hint of acetone

**Taste**: The taste actually starts off nicely with a little sweet and a touch of spice but nothing ever comes of it

**Finish**: Almost none, it sort of caught me by surprise when it ended

### On a rock

**Nose**: I mostly smelled the ice and the glass

**Taste**: Opens up a lot smooth with a little more of the sweet and spice blend from the neat

**Finish**: Equally short but I was ready for it this time

## Dark Rye

**Mashbill**: Unknown but some blend of Rye, Canadian and Port?

**Abv**: 80 proof (40% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

## Review

**Color**: A dark red and brown, lives up to the "Dark" part of the name

### Neat

**Nose**: Smells strongly of something sweet, almost like maple syrup. Definitely the port coming through,

**Taste**: Not good. All the worst parts of rye whiskey, Canadian whiskey and port come together to taste like sadness. Notes of syrup and nail polish remover.

**Finish**: Blessedly short

### On a rock

**Nose**: The sickly sweetness is more muted and some fruit starts to creep into the nose

**Taste**: More palpable but not by much. I can't even.

**Finish**: Again blessedly short

## Conclusion 
Basil Hayden's straight bourbon is solid but completely unremarkable; nothing wrong with it but nothing exciting either. I used to really enjoy it but as I've learned to appreciate more complex and stronger flavors it's fallen by the wayside. I still usually have a bottle on my shelf since it's a good entry point for newer folks and because my dad likes it. THe Dark Rye on the other hand is awful. Easily the worst whiskey over $20 for a bottle I've ever had. I poured out the rest of my glass after writing this. I think it's discontinued in favor of their Darker Rye and Two by Two but if you do see it don't buy it just to be safe.

### Straight Bourbon
6/10 - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

### Dark Rye

3/10 -  no thanks

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
