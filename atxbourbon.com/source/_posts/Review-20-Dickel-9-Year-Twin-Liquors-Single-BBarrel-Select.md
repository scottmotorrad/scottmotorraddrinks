Traditionally I haven't been a fan of Dickel but after u/bananavanman having me try the [Dickel sourced Barrell](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/12/Review-14-Barrell-Bourbon-Batch-008B-as-a-Mystery-Sample/) and my dad telling me he had a 'fancy Dickel' that was super good I decided to give it another go. So here we are reviewing George Dickel Barrel No 05A04 B 1-5-24 whatever that means. More importantly it is a 9 year single barrel select from the Twin Liquors near my go to HEB and I'm a sucker for well aged single barrel selects :) 

## Review
**Age**: 9 years

**Abv**: 103 proof (51.5% ABV)

**Color**: A dark reddish amber

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and a little smoky with rich vanilla notes like toasting a fancy marshmallow or slightly overcooking some french toast

**Taste**: The marshmallow notes come on strong and are shortly joined by a surprising cherry note

**Finish**: The cherry and sweetness briefly linger before giving way to a very pleasant lingering baking spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: The cherry notes creep into the nose to compliment the sweet vanilla and smokiness

**Taste**: This almost tastes like french toast with cherries on top. Sweet vanilla, bright cherries and some baking spice

**Finish**: The baking spice finish come sup faster than it did without ice but still lingers just as long.

## Conclusion
I was very pleasantly surprised by this whiskey and really enjoyed the combination of sweet, cherry and spicy notes. I always enjoy a lingering spicy finish and this bottle delivered. Overall this has restored my interest in Dickel or at least their well aged single barrel offerings. I'd really like to try a variation of this that wasn't chill filtered and/or was bottled at barrel proof. A version of this with a better mouth feel and the same notes but stronger would probably eek its way into the 8s for me.
