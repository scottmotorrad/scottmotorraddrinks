George Remus is MGP's in house brand and I've been a fan of several of their releases so far so I was excited to get the chance to help with a barrel pick earlier this year. Since I was part of the group that picked the barrel I’m a little biased but I think it’s a great pick. No review/score but here are my tasting notes:

## George Remus Single Barrel Oak Liquor Cabinet Pick
**Age**: 6 years

**Abv**: 123.7 proof

**Price**: $60

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with vanilla, caramel and honey notes with a bit of spice underneath

**Taste**: Sweet fruit, more vanilla, caramel, warm spice and slightly tannic oak towards the end.

**Finish**: Long and lingering with cinnamon, oak and vanilla notes. 

## Conclusion

I think this was better than most of the recent 5 year SAOS picks and I'm very much looking forward to some older single barrels coming out of George Remus!

**TL;DR:** Younger MGP that's on the sweet side and drinks well below it's proof
