I just got back from a trip to the UK where I had the chance to drink a fair amount of Blanton's Gold and snag a couple of bottles to take home with me. Blanton's Gold is a higher proof, export only version of the sought after bourbon. Let's see what we are missing out on here in the States with a little side by side tasting.

## Blanton's Gold
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 103 proof

**Color**: A deep gold

**Price**: ~$120 on Amazon UK

**Bottle**: Warehouse H Rick #56 Barrel #1912 Bottle #135

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet caramel and bright citrus

**Taste**: Rich oak with more caramel and citrus plus some baking spice

**Finish**: Medium to long finish with oak, warm spice and vanilla

### On a rock
**Nose**: Sweet caramel but the citrus notes are gone

**Taste**: Very nice mouthfeel with oak and caramel notes, the citrus and spice are quenched by the ice

**Finish**: Short with a bit of oak

## Conclusion
This was some great bourbon. Compared to usual [Blanton's Single Barrel](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/04/16/Review-107-Blanton-s-Single-Barrel/) this was slightly darker, spicier, oakier, more caramel than vanilla and had an improved mouthfeel. It also held up to ice much better if that's your thing. It was an all around upgrade. It's a fun souvenir from Europe and if I could pick it up in the States I would from time to time but the regular expression is close enough for me.

Next time I'll try to track down the SFTB.

**2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle
