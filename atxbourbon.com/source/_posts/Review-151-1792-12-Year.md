I'm still a fan of 1792 even though my initial 1792 craze has subsided now that I've tried them all so when I heard they were releasing a 12 year I was excited then I heard it was only going to be 96.6 proof which seemed like an odd choice but it was close enough to 100 that I was still game to try it.

## 1792 12 Year
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 96.6 proof

**Price**: $50

### Neat
**Nose**: Oaky with some of that classic 1792 caramel and vanilla sweetness lurking beneath the oak.

**Taste**: The palate starts somewhat sweet with vanilla and chocolate notes then transitions into a heavy, dry oak.

**Finish**: Dry and oaky finish with mere hints of vanilla.

**0 Stars** - **Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

## Conclusion

As expected for the first high age statement product released under the 1792 label this was very oaky. I still enjoyed it and this made me understand why Barton 1792 tends to release younger bourbon. I'm still glad I picked this up but I won't be getting another. There are too many good 1792 Full Proof and Bottled in Bond picks out there to justify hunting this down and if I am going to hunt 1792 I am looking for Sweet Wheat over this guy.

I'm surprised how well balanced [Cream of Kentucky](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/07/28/Review-131-Cream-of-Kentucky-Batch-2/) is in comparison and I can sort of see why the price point on that bottle is so high now. Barton must have parted with some of their best well aged bottles.

**TL;DR:** Oaky but good, [stick with store picks](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/19/Reviews-51-53-Oak-Liquor-Cabinet-1792-Picks/) or Sweet Wheat for 1792
