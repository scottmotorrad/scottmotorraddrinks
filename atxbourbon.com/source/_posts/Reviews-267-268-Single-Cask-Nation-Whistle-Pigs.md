For part 27 of the finished whiskey series we are taking a look at the new Single Cask Nation Whistle Pig bottles! Single Cask Nation has had some legendary releases over the years so when they announced they were releasing not one, but two, MGP sourced Whistle Pigs and that they would both have sweet finishes I knew I needed to include at least one of them in this series. Thankfully I got lucky in their raffle and was able to get both bottles.

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet red fruit, herbs and rye spice.

**Finish**: Very long finish with red fruit fading to oak, herbs and rye spice.

**4 Stars** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite

## Conclusion

The Rum and Vermouth finished bottle is right up there with the [High West Rendezvous Rye Barrel Select finished in Port Casks for 4 years and 7 months](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/31/Review-58-High-West-Rendezvous-Rye-Barrel-Select-Port-Finish-2018/) for my favorite rye whiskey of all time. It has everything I like about an MGP rye perfectly balanced by everything I like about a sweet finish. The herbal notes aren't on the dill end, the sweetness is just right, the rich fruits are delicious and there is enough spice and oak to lend complexity without it being too spicy or dry. The Tokaji finish was very much an MGP rye whiskey and the barrel finish had a lot less influence for me. That said it did lend a little extra sweetness is pleasant way.

Overall I am super happy with these releases and I wish I could have gotten a backup on the Rum and Vermouth. Shipping was a slow, as is tradition with SCN, but I really wanted to include these in this series as it approaches its end.
