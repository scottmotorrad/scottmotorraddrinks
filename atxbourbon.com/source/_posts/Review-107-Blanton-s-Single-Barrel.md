I recently had some friends from a local bourbon group tell me that Caribou Crossing was basically Canadian Blanton's so I went and tracked some down and did a side by side taste off. Blanton's is a  NAS single barrel release from Buffalo Trace that comes in a fancy bottles and has garnered a lot of hype lately.

## Blanton's Single Barrel
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 93 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $61.99

**Bottle**: Warehouse H Rick #26 Barrel #1409 Bottle #278  

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet honey, vanilla and warm spice notes.

**Taste**: Sweet honey again but with more spice than the nose, less vanilla and some citrus notes. Very easy to drink but with a decent mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium length and slightly dry with lingering spice and a little vanilla.

## Conclusion
When you get past all the hype this is still a great bourbon and I'll gladly pick it up at near retail whenever I can. It's especially good as a step up from 80 proof entry level, for lack of a better phrase, bourbons. That said I really don't think it's worth the hunt especially when you can grab the more readily available, higher proof and similarly priced EHT Single Barrel.

Next time we'll see how the Caribou stacks up!

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
