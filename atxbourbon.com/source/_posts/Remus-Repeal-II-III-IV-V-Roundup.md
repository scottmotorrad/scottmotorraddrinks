In writing my last post I realized that I had never reviewed any of the previous Remus Repeals and still had at least a few ounces of each one that hit Texas (so no batch 1) so here we go!

## Remus Repeal II

**Age**: Blend of 10 and 11 year

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: Best nose of the bunch with leather, oak, caramel and vanilla extract. The palate brings more leather, more oak and more caramel plus a nice bit of spice. The mouthfeel is above average for 100 proof. The finish is medium length but with a great flavor of caramel cream and warm spice.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

## Remus Repeal III

**Age**: Blend of 11 and 12 year

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is sweet and oaky with a nice vanilla note plus a bit of spice. The palate has a buttercream sweetness, warm spice, oak and something slightly acidic/bitter (citrus maybe?). The finish is very long with more of the same and the mouthfeel is quite nice.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Remus Repeal IV

**Age**: 12 years

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is faint with only a bit of sweet and oak. The palate brings a rich brown sugar and more rich oak. The finish is long and well balanced with baking spice, oak and more brown sugar

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


## Remus Repeal V

**Age**: Blend of 13 to 16 year

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet notes of toasted oak, caramel and vanilla frosting on the nose. The palate is rich and balanced with vanilla, caramel, leather and a bit of dried fruit. The mouthfeel is excellent for 100 proof. The finish is long and slightly dry like a nice red wine with lingering vanilla and warm spice.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

V and III were the standouts for me. IV was all sweet and oak in a good way that reminds of an MGP take on Eagle Rare. II had a great nose and the palate didn't quite measure up to that high bar. Overall these were great whiskies with no losers in the bunch. I hope they can get back to this level with VII.

**TL;DR:** V > III > II> IV >> VI
