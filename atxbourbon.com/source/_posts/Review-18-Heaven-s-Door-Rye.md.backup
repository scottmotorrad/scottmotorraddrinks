Heaven's Door is a whiskey line that is somehow associated with Bob Dylan and while I generally stay away from celebrity endorsed whiskey(or at least try it a bar) I somehow ended up buying this bottle shortly after release through a combination of good reviews at the top of a Google search and the recommendation of a staff member from Twin Liquors. It's been collecting dust on my shelf for a while now so it seemed like a good time to do a review. The rye is sourced, most likely from MGP, and is finished in some sort of fancy barrel that is supposed to make it more accessible than most rye whiskies.

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 92 proof (46% ABV)

**Color**: A medium amber

### Neat
**Nose**: Fresh herbs with strong dill notes and a more subtle note of floral honey 

**Taste**: More herbs, especially dill, with a hint of baking spice and some sweetness but not too much

**Finish**: Thankfully the dill gives way to mostly baking spice with a bit of lingering sweetness

### On a rock
**Nose**: The dill is mercifully gone leaving the floral honey to rise to the top

**Taste**: Starts a little sweet then gets dilly and finally transitions to dill and baking spice 

**Finish**: Somehow more dill than the neat?

## Conclusion
Overall I wasn't a fan. I don't generally like heavy herbal notes in whiskey especially dill or coriander though the sweet and spicy finish on the neat pour was a highlight. This is actually the only bottle in my collection that I currently regret buying, my wife bought the Dark Rye :). It tastes like under aged MGP to me with heavy emphasis on the dill notes. Especially for the price I was expecting a lot more. If I'm looking for pricey sourced rye I'll probably stick with High West's [A Mid Winter Night's Dram](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/19/Review-16-A-Mid-Winter-Night-s-Dram-Act-5-Scene-3-Mystery-Sample/) or Yipee Kay Yay.

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this
