When I went to Kentucky for the r/bourbon New Riff pick last fall I also did a mad dash around various distilleries and snagged a few goodies along the way including a bottle of Elijah Craig 18. There was some sort of running event going on in the Bardstown area that day and it either finished or had a checkpoint or something at the Heaven Hill Bourbon Heritage Center so the parking lot was full of sweaty fit people but I persevered, made my way through the dank crowd and went inside anyway. I was rewarded with a lonesome bottle of Elijah Craig 18 in a glass case behind the counter so I sheepishly asked if it was for sale and it was! They also had William Heaven Hill 12 and Elijah Craig Barrel proof but the WHH was ludicrously expensive even by my standards and I don't have trouble getting ECBP at home so I happily went with the 18 year.

## Elijah Craig 18
**Age**: 18 years

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Price**: $150

**Bottled On**: 6/13/19

**Barrel Number**: 4636

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich and balanced with sweet vanilla, oak and allspice notes. 

**Taste**: Less sweet than the nose with that classic nutty Heaven Hill note backed by more oak, spice and vanilla. Surprisingly good mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Long lingering finish with vanilla, oak, a different type of spice and one of my favorite notes: leather.

## Conclusion

This was a great pour especially when I am in the mood for something easier to drink but still very flavorful. I really enjoy how well balanced this is between the oak, spice and sweetness and the finish is outstanding. That said it doesn't make sense to me to release a rare, expensive single barrel at such a low proof though especially when William Heaven Hill and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof tend to be quite high proof. When I compare this to another pricey Heaven Hill special release, Old Fitzgerald BiB, it doesn't hold up. I've enjoyed every pour and I'm glad I got this bottle but it's not something I love and I definitely won't be looking to replace it based on the cost and scarcity.

It's expensive, hard to find, lower proof and a single barrel so a bit of a gamble. What's not to love?

**TL;DR:** Expensive for what it is, also inexplicably low proof


**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies
