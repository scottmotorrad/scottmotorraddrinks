I managed to snag a bottle of the new Old Forester Rye Whisky and couldn't wait to do a review. I wanted to try alongside another rye or two. The Willett 4 Year has been sitting around, 40% full, waiting to be reviewed and then killed so it seemed like an good matchup especially with OF claiming "There is nothing better on the market." So let's see how they stack up!

## Old Forester Rye Whisky

{% asset_img image2.jpg "Old Forester Rye"%}

**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Color**: A deep reddish amber 

**Price**: $19.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Strong brown sugar with some rye spice and candied apple with hints of floral notes

**Taste**: Rye spice and cinnamon dominate the taste with a bit of apple as well. Very luscious mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium to long, dry finish with cinnamon fading to baking spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: Caramel apple and rye spice notes

**Taste**: The taste and mouthfeel do well with the ice. The rye and apple notes are still prevalent with the cinnamon taking a bit of backseat

**Finish**: The finish is shortened a bit but is less dry with strong cinnamon notes throughout

## Willett Family Estate Bottled Small Batch Rye

**Age**: 4 years

**Abv**: 114.4 proof

**Color**: A deep rust color 

**Price**: $54.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Rye spice and dark cherries, it had a slight acetone note at first so I let it rest another 5 minutes and it cleared out

**Taste**: Warm, spiced dark cherry pie with an excellent mouthfeel

**Finish**:Long, dry finish with cherry fading to a lingering rye spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: The dark cherry notes are still very prevalent with less rye spice than neat

**Taste**: Very strong dark cherry notes with some baking spice and brown sugar

**Finish**: Medium length warm finish with strong cherry notes fading to rye spice

## Conclusion
The Old Forester Rye is potentially the best $20 whisky I've had and the Willett is serious contender in the ~$50 price range as well. I did prefer the Willett but not by much. They do both diverge from the super spicy or herbal/dill forward profiles of most ryes I've tasted though. I tasted these two alongside a pour of [High West Double Rye!](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/22/Reviews-55-High-West-Double-Rye-2018/) after writing my initial notes and they both easily outclassed it. Though to be fair I tend to prefer fruity notes over herbal ones. I definitely feel like High West and Heaven Hill need to step it up now that there is some serious competition in the low cost rye market. The Willett is right there with [Whistle Pig 10 Year](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/03/Review-38-Whistle-Pig-Rye-10-Year/) and [High West Rendezvous Rye](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/23/Review-44-High-West-Rendezvous-Rye/) for me though it doesn't quite hit [MWND status](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/01/04/Review-61-High-West-A-Mid-Winter-Night-s-Dram-Act-6-Scene-5/). Either way color me impressed with both these distilleries releasing new, in house distilled rye whiskies at reasonable prices in the current climate even if the OF claim of "There is nothing better on the market" is a bit of hyberbole. 

### Old Forester Rye Whisky
