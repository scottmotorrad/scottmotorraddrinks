The folks at Bardstown were kind enough to send me samples of their newly acquired Green River Bourbon both the rye recipe and the wheated.

## Green River Bourbon

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: The youth comes through, grain and spice, slightly herbal. Vanilla frosting sweetness.

## Green River Wheated Bourbon

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: Soft, sweet, hints of nuts reminds me a good bit of Larceny. Honey wheat bread, spice on the finish. Vanilla and oak on the finish.

**TL;DR:** Looking forward to a higher proof and/or age stated release!
