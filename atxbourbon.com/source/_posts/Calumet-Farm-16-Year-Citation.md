When Calumet announced a 16 year old Kentucky bourbon (or more realistically when [@comingwhiskey](https://www.instagram.com/comingwhiskey/?hl=en) posted it on Instagram) I was intrigued. We don't see very many KY sourced releases break that 15 year mark so I decided I needed a bottle.

## Calumet Farm 16 Year Citation

**Age**: 16 years

**Proof**: 106

### Neat

**Notes**: Delicious old bourbon notes of rich oak, leather and brown sugar with a touch of bitterness and some warm spice on the very long finish. Excellent mouthfeel and proof integration.

**Stars**: **3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

This was really good and definitely surprised me. I have tasted Calumet's 14 and 15 year old releases which were also enjoyable but didn't stand out at the time. The proofing on this is just right, it's strong enough to let you know it's there but had no burn for me. I was also impressed that the mouthfeel and finish weren't dry at all given the age. I would easily put this in the top tier of old sourced Kentucky bourbon that you can actually find!

Also apparently this whiskey is named after a champion race horse.

**TL;DR:** Excellent bottle that hits all the right old bourbon notes. Worth the price.
