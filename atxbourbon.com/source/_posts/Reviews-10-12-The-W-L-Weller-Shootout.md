## Info
I was finally able to get bottle of WL Weller 12 year to complete my set so it's time to do the Weller Triple Review Shootout! I first had the Weller Antique 107 at [drink.well](https://www.drinkwellaustin.com/) and over the last couple months have been able to get all 3 bottles from various local liquor stores. For this review I've upgraded to a set of Glencairns from my old High West neat glass. 

## Special Reserve

**Mashbill**: Wheater

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

## Review

**Color**: A medium gold like liquid honey

### Neat

**Nose**: Primarily caramel with a bit of something I can't place. I think it's a bit earthy?

**Taste**: A little more watery than I thought it was going to be especially given the slightly higher proof. The caramel is still there but less present than it was in the nose. The something earthy from the nose starts to come through as wood notes

**Finish**: The wood notes crescendo here and there is just a touch of spice on the finish

### On a rock

**Nose**: Just a touch sweet and touch woody

**Taste**: Very watery but still sweet with caramel notes.

**Finish**: Short and spicy. A nice surprise.


## Antique 107

**Mashbill**: Wheater

**Abv**: 107 proof (53.5% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

## Review

**Color**: A darker gold, very appealing

### Neat

**Nose**: Vanilla and floral honey

**Taste**: Smooth and sweet especially up front; more vanilla and honey. Spicy notes build as you go especially on subsequent sips

**Finish**: Decently lingering Baking spice and something festive. Nutmeg or cinnamon perhaps?

### On a rock

**Nose**: Smooth vanilla notes, any traces of something floral are gone

**Taste**: All vanilla, all over your mouth

**Finish**: Less lingering but still nice a spicy


## 12 Year

**Mashbill**: Wheater

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Age**: 12 years

## Review

**Color**: Surprisingly about the same as the Special Reserve

### Neat

**Nose**: Rich and sweet predominantly vanilla with strong caramel supporting notes

**Taste**: Sweet and smooth with a bit of oak but I don't get a particular type of sweet

**Finish**: A very nice combination of smooth and sweet with clear oak notes, surprisingly long for such a subtly flavored finish 

### On a rock

**Nose**: A more subtle caramel note

**Taste**: Delicious a brilliantly balanced combination of caramel and oak

**Finish**: Unfortunately dampened and shortened by the ice but still sweet and oaky

## Conclusion 
This was a ton of fun especially after [my last review](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/14/Reviews-8-9-Wild-Turkey-101-and-Jack-Daniel-s-7-on-a-plane/) :P

One thing that really stood out to me here is that I preferred the SR and 12 Year neat over on ice and the Antique 107 I could go either way; that's pretty rare for me. It was really hard for me to pick a winner between the 107 and the 12 but the higher proof lets the 107 perform well with ice and it's a hell of a lot easier for me to find so if I had to pick I'd go with it. The SR is super overhyped to me, it's good and a nice intro to wheaters but it really doesn't stand out of the crowd in that price and availability range for me. 

Overall it's a great collection and tasting all 3 at once was awesome, highly recommended.

To round out the Weller collection checkout [my review](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/14/Review-4-William-Larue-Weller/) of the William Larue Weller . Spoiler: It's the best of the bunch but not by as much as you'd think! The 107 really holds its own even against higher end wheaters

### Special Reserve
[**5**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/5/) - a whiskey with notable strengths but also held back by some flaws

### Antique 107
[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

### 12 Year
[**7**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/7/) - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar
