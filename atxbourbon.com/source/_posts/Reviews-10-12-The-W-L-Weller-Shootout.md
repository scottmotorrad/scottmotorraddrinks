## Info
I was finally able to get bottle of WL Weller 12 year to complete my set so it's time to do the Weller Triple Review Shootout! I first had the Weller Antique 107 at [drink.well](https://www.drinkwellaustin.com/) and over the last couple months have been able to get all 3 bottles from various local liquor stores. For this review I've upgraded to a set of Glencairns from my old High West neat glass. 

## Special Reserve

**Mashbill**: Wheater

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

## Review

**Color**: A medium gold like liquid honey

### Neat

**Nose**: Primarily caramel with a bit of something I can't place. I think it's a bit earthy?

**Taste**: A little more watery than I thought it was going to be especially given the slightly higher proof. The caramel is still there but less present than it was in the nose. The something earthy from the nose starts to come through as wood notes

**Finish**: The wood notes crescendo here and there is just a touch of spice on the finish

### On a rock

**Nose**: Just a touch sweet and touch woody

**Taste**: Very watery but still sweet with caramel notes.

**Finish**: Short and spicy. A nice surprise.


## Antique 107

**Mashbill**: Wheater

**Abv**: 107 proof (53.5% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

## Review

**Color**: A darker gold, very appealing

### Neat

**Nose**: Vanilla and floral honey

**Taste**: Smooth and sweet especially up front; more vanilla and honey. Spicy notes build as you go especially on subsequent sips

**Finish**: Decently lingering Baking spice and something festive. Nutmeg or cinnamon perhaps?

### On a rock

**Nose**: Smooth vanilla notes, any traces of something floral are gone

**Taste**: All vanilla, all over your mouth

**Finish**: Less lingering but still nice a spicy


## 12 Year

**Mashbill**: Wheater

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Age**: 12 years

## Review

**Color**: Surprisingly about the same as the Special Reserve

### Neat

**Nose**: Rich and sweet predominantly vanilla with strong caramel supporting notes

**Taste**: Sweet and smooth with a bit of oak but I don't get a particular type of sweet

**Finish**: A very nice combination of smooth and sweet with clear oak notes, surprisingly long for such a subtly flavored finish 

### On a rock

**Nose**: A more subtle caramel note

**Taste**: Delicious a brilliantly balanced combination of caramel and oak

**Finish**: Unfortunately dampened and shortened by the ice but still sweet and oaky

## Conclusion 
This was a ton of fun especially after [my last review](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/14/Reviews-8-9-Wild-Turkey-101-and-Jack-Daniel-s-7-on-a-plane/) :P

One thing that really stood out to me here is that I preferred the SR and 12 Year neat over on ice and the Antique 107 I could go either way; that's pretty rare for me. It was really hard for me to pick a winner between the 107 and the 12 but the higher proof lets the 107 perform well with ice and it's a hell of a lot easier for me to find so if I had to pick I'd go with it. The SR is super overhyped to me, it's good and a nice intro to wheaters but it really doesn't stand out of the crowd in that price and availability range for me. 

Overall it's a great collection and tasting all 3 at once was awesome, highly recommended.

To round out the Weller collection checkout [my review](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/14/Review-4-William-Larue-Weller/) of the William Larue Weller . Spoiler: It's the best of the bunch but not by as much as you'd think! The 107 really holds its own even against higher end wheaters

### Special Reserve
6/10 - decent, would definitely drink and would order somewhere with an otherwise poor selection

### Antique 107
8/10 - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

### 12 Year
8/10 - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
