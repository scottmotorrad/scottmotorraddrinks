Part 13 of my finished whiskey series is back to Blood Oath with the newly released Pact 6. This Pact has both the oldest and youngest bourbons they've disclosed so far (Pacts 1-3 didn't have age information) with a 14 year and a 7 year. From their ryed little pun in the description I think all 3 of the components are rye bourbon with no wheater in the blend but who knows?

## Review # 228 Blood Oath Pact 6
**Age**: A blend of 7, 8 and 14 year old bourbons

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Price**: $85

### Neat

**Nose**: Nutty(pecan?), sweet dark fruit, warm spice and vanilla.

**Taste**: Butterscotch, vanilla cream, pecans, dark fruit and cinnamon. A bit thinner on the mouthfeel than I prefer but not enough to take away from the dram.

**Finish**: Long finish with leather, cinnamon, pecan and vanilla notes.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed this year's Blood Oath and found it to be a step up from last year. It's a dessert bourbon for sure with a lot of decadent sweet notes. The cognac influence was there but did not overwhelm the bourbon at all and just added a nice dark fruit note for me. I didn't really get much in the way of woody oak notes, just some spice and cinnamon. The nose and finish were both excellent and my only real complaint is the mouthfeel which is going to be hard to do anything about as long as they insist on the 98.6 blood temperature proof.

I'll definitely be grabbing a backup bottle.
