I'm going to mix it up a little bit with some quick beer reviews with a heavy emphasis on the centralish Texas breweries that are my mainstays. I don't pretend to know too much about beer or how to review it but you have to start somewhere and apparently somewhere is a ridiculous Martin House beer.

The 3rd release of Melted is an ice cream ale that somehow incorporates salted caramel ice cream and waffle cones, of course.

First off this does what is says on the tin. The caramel, ice cream and waffle cone come through very strongly. It's almost a little too waffley for me. The salt is the only part of the description that I don't get much of but it is there. The creamy texture is a highlight for me as is the long aftertaste. At 5.2% the alcohol isn't too present and this is an easy choice for a dessert beer outside of that I am not sure when I would drink one of these. 

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over similar readily available beers


**TL;DR:** Heavy but tasty dessert beer.
