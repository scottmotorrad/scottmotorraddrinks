## Blue Note 17

**Age**: 17 years

**Proof**: 92.3

### Neat

**Nose**: Pancake batter, rich oak and a bit of the Dickel mineral/vitamin notes

**Taste**: More vanilla, more oak and subtle but present minerality. Really nice, creamy mouthfeel especially impressive for the proof.

**Finish**: Long slightly dry finish with linger vanilla cream frosting and tannic oak notes

## Conclusion

First off I am enjoying this bottle and I tend to like Dickel more than most online reviewers. The nose inviting, flavors are simple but pleasant, the mouthfeel is great and it is very easy drinking. Blue Note 17 Year is definitely on the high end of the Dickel profile but still not good enough to stand out and command the $150 price tag. If you aren't a Dickel fan this is an easy pass. If you are a Dickel fan I'd stick with the BiB or the 15 year from Dickel and skip these $100+ NDP bottlings.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

**TL;DR:** Great whiskey at an unfortunately low proof and too high a price.
