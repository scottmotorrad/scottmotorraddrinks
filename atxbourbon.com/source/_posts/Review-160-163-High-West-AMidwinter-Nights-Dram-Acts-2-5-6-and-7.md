As is tradition I got a bottle of this year's A Midwinter Nights Dram, specifically Act 7 Scene 4. I liked the new act though it seemed to be getting mixed feedback online with a fair number of folks pining for the older releases. I tend to that it's about 50-50 when folks complain about how older whiskey was better. Sometimes the whiskey has gotten younger and worse for it but other times I think they are just looking back with rose colored glasses.

Anyways I set out to do a blind tasting of some newer and older MWNDs and was able to scrounge up samples of Acts 2, 5 and 6 to blind taste against Act 7. [I recorded it and posted it to Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5GnzAwH1TK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) before sitting down the next day(yesterday) to write this version and spend a bit more time with each sample.

## Act 2.4 Scene 1048

**Age**: 6 year MGP and 16 year Barton

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Mashbill**: 

* 95/5 rye/malted barley (MGP)
* 80/10/10 rye/corn/malted barley (Barton)

### Neat
**Nose**: Rye spice, rich herbal and subtler dark fruit notes

**Taste**: Spicy and herbal with rye spice, herbs including a distinct but not overwhelming dill note and a bit of sweetness. Great mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Very long, warm and sweet with a clear port influence and rich dark fruit and holiday spice notes that gets a little too spicy at the end for me.

## Act 5 Scene 8

**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Mashbill**: 

* 95/5 rye/malted barley (MGP)
* 53/37/10 rye/corn/malted barley (Barton)
* 80/10/10 rye/corn/malted barley (Barton)

### Neat
**Nose**: Warm spice, rye bread, cherry and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: Sweet dark fruit, herbal(no clear dill note but maybe a hint?) and warm spice notes with a hint of something else sweet. The mouthfeel is solid but not as nice as the Act 2.

**Finish**: Medium to long finish with more cherry and warm spice. Also gets a little too hot right at the end like the Act 2.

## Act 6 Scene 4

**Age**: NAS years

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Mashbill**: 

* 95/5 rye/malted barley (MGP)
* 80/20 rye/malted rye (High West) 
* 53/37/10 rye/corn/malted barley (Barton)
* 80/10/10 rye/corn/malted barley (Barton) 

### Neat
**Nose**: Warm and sweet with cherry, vanilla, warm spice and herbal notes

**Taste**: Herbaceous then sweet with herbal notes, sweet cherry and a touch spice. Great mouthfeel but still not quite Act 2 level though a step up from Act 5.

**Finish**: Very long, sweet and lightly spicy with more cherry and baking spice notes. No heat flare from 2 or 5.

## Conclusion

These were all great! I feel pretty justified in my old reviews of [Act 6](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/01/04/Review-61-High-West-A-Mid-Winter-Night-s-Dram-Act-6-Scene-5/) and [Act 5](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/19/Review-16-A-Mid-Winter-Night-s-Dram-Act-5-Scene-3-Mystery-Sample/) now as well. The older Acts(2 and 5) were much more traditional MGP/Barton ye with a lot of herbal notes and a little more heat. The more recent releases were definitely sweeter and fruitier which was great for me. Overall 6 was the clear winner and 2 was the clear loser with 5 getting a slight nod over 7.

I am going to keep buying these for the foreseeable future since they are trending up on average for me.  I do hope they nail down a great ratio of their distillate to sourced stuff instead of radically changing it each year and lean in a little more on the port finishing time to hopefully get closer to replicating [my favorite High West of all time](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/31/Review-58-High-West-Rendezvous-Rye-Barrel-Select-Port-Finish-2018/).

**TL;DR:** MWND is good; 6>5>7>2 for me; more port finish is more my style
