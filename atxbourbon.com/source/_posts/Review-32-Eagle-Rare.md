Eagle Rare isn't particularly rare and has nothing to do with eagles. It is a bourbon from Buffalo Trace that carries a 10 year age statement. In my opinion it's the first step up in the Buffalo Trace bourbon lineup so let's get to it.

## Review
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Color**: A deep amber

**Price**: $32.99

### Neat
**Nose**: A little hot despite the middling proof though with otherwise nicely balanced brown sugar, vanilla and leather notes 

**Taste**: A little thin with more leather and a sweet note that isn't quite as distinctly brown sugar than the nose

**Finish**: Finally a bit of spice! A more caramel sweetness here on the end with a nice, long linger

### On a rock
**Nose**: The heat is gone and the brown sugar and leather held strong and something a little brighter crept in almost a floral or herbal note

**Taste**: A much improved mouth feel with a balance of sweet and a little nutty though the leather still lingers in the background 

**Finish**: A bright lingering warmth with hints of sugar spice and leather. Probably my favorite part of this whiskey

## Conclusion
Eagle Rare, what to say..? Is it is good? Of course. Is it overhyped? Yes, especially nowadays. All that aside it is a great whiskey at a great price and a solid intro into the next tier of Buffalo Trace offerings before you're ready to shell out for the Colonel Taylor Line. 

**7** - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar

**Great** - A great deal, I'd buy it again
