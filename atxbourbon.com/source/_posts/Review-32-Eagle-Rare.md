Eagle Rare isn't particularly rare and has nothing to do with eagles. It is a bourbon from Buffalo Trace that carries a 10 year age statement. In my opinion it's the first step up in the Buffalo Trace bourbon lineup so let's get to it.

## Review
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Color**: A deep amber

**Price**: $32.99

### Neat
**Nose**: A little hot despite the middling proof though with otherwise nicely balanced brown sugar, vanilla and leather notes 

**Taste**: A little thin with more leather and a sweet note that isn't quite as distinctly brown sugar than the nose

**Finish**: Finally a bit of spice! A more caramel sweetness here on the end with a nice, long linger

### On a rock
**Nose**: The heat is gone and the brown sugar and leather held strong and something a little brighter crept in almost a floral or herbal note

**Taste**: A much improved mouth feel with a balance of sweet and a little nutty though the leather still lingers in the background 

**Finish**: A bright lingering warmth with hints of sugar spice and leather. Probably my favorite part of this whiskey

## Conclusion
Eagle Rare, what to say..? Is it is good? Of course. Is it overhyped? Yes, especially nowadays. All that aside it is a great whiskey at a great price and a solid intro into the next tier of Buffalo Trace offerings before you're ready to shell out for the Colonel Taylor Line. 

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
