I'm gearing up for my annual holiday trip back to Park City, Utah sop it's time to start reviewing some High West! Unfortunately the distillery opened when I was in high school so I missed the early years but my folks used to get me bottles for Christmas and birthdays and the like when I was in college. Those early bottles of Rendezvous Rye and A Mid Winter Night's Dram were a big part of what brought me over to bourbon and rye from the scotch world. I picked up a little bottle of Rendezvous Rye Batch 16E12 at [Oak Liquor Cabinet](https://www.instagram.com/oakliquorcabinet/) today so let's get to it.

## Review
**Age**: 6-16 years

**Abv**: 92 Proof

**Color**: Amber

**Mashbill**: *Blend of two*: 95% rye, 5% barley malt and 80% rye, 10% corn, and 10% barley malt

**Price**: $54.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Delicious sweet vanilla and clove

**Taste**: Not as spicy as I expected and surprisingly sweet with caramel, vanilla and allspice notes

**Finish**: Long lingering rye spice and clove with just a hint of dill

### On a rock
**Nose**: 

**Taste**: The herbal and spicy notes are more present over ice with clove and dill notes taking the center stage and sweet vanilla in the background

**Finish**: Very similar to the neat finish with the same rye spice, clove and dill notes but also with a bit of vanilla. 

## Conclusion
This is a 2016 bottling so it's old MGP and Barton blend. I haven't had much of Barton's rye lineup(other than High West) though I am at fan of their bourbons, especially the 1792 lineup. It still has that dill note I associate with MGP ryes but it is definitely toned down compared to bottlings that are 100% MGP which is an improvement imo. If you can get your hands on one of the older High West bottles definitely grab it. Also I'm a big fan of 375ml bottles so I can try more things so I'm very happy to see High West releasing a lot of their lineup in little bottles as well.
