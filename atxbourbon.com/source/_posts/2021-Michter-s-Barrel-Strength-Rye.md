## 2021 Michter's Barrel Strength Rye

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 114.2

**Barrel No**: 21B410

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is big and spicy with plenty of holiday spice balanced by a sweet vanilla frosting. The palate is warm and sweet with more spice and vanilla plus some subtler herbal notes. The finish is medium length and a little hot with classic rye notes.

**Stars**: **1** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

**TL;DR:** Overall I really enjoyed this one and it’s definitely worth the retail price. I wouldn’t hunt one down or overpay though.
