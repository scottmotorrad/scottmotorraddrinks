Week 14 of Sample Mountain is Angel's Envy Cask Strength Week! I was in Kentcuky this week picking barrels for a couple local stores when I trolled self by buying 4 1oz samples of Angel's Envy Cask Strength from their gift shop effectively setting my sample clearing project back by a week :/

Angel's Envy releases a cask strength version of their port finished bourbon once a year but they have a deep library of samples for sale at their gift shop. I picked the 2013 because it was the oldest, 2020 because it was the newest and then 2 in between based on the provided tasting notes. All I know for sure if that this is Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey finished in port casks and that Angel's Envy sources from multiple distilleries. I'd guess there is at least some Heaven Hill in the blends but who knows?

## Angel's Envy Cask Strength 2013

**Proof**: 123

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with vanilla and dried fruit notes with hints of nuts underneath. Gentle for the proof.

**Taste**: Similar to the nose but with more of a caramel sweetness. Same dried fruit and nuts balanced with some oak. Nice mouthfeel as I would expect for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium to long finish with a sticky sweetness and some bitter oak.

**Buy a bottle?** No

## Angel's Envy Cask Strength 2014

**Proof**: 119.4

### Neat
**Nose**: Deep and rich with dark fruit, sweet caramel, rich oak and bit of chocolate.

**Taste**: Almost like an armagnac with dark fruit, oak, leather and sweet caramel plus that bit of chocolate from the nose. Great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long and lingering with rich oak, dried fruit and faint spice.

**Buy a bottle?** Probably if I'd found it at retail back in the day

## Angel's Envy Cask Strength 2017

**Proof**: 124.5

### Neat
**Nose**: Very similar to the 2013 but a little nuttier and more potent.

**Taste**: Nice caramel sweetness, nutty notes, warm spice and fainter but present dried fruit. Good mouthfeel in line with the proof.

**Finish**: Nice, long finish with sweet caramel and slightly bitter oak.

**Buy a bottle?** No

## Angel's Envy Cask Strength 2020

**Proof**: 120.4

### Neat
**Nose**: Dark and rich with dark fruit and vanilla cream notes.

**Taste**: Holiday spices, dried fruit, sweet vanilla and oak.

**Finish**: Long sweet and spicy finish with just a little bit of bitter oak.

**Buy a bottle?** No

## Conclusion

To start with the positives all of these had great proof integration and were surprisingly(dangerously?) easy to drink for being around 120 proof. They also all tasted like bourbon with port influence so good job doing what it says on the label. Otherwise for the most part these were enjoyable but nothing special especially given the limited nature and high price point. The one possible exception was the 2014 which reminded me of Bardstown Bourbon Company Chateau De Laubade and of Blood Oath 6 in a very nice way. That said I am a fan of both of those releases and they were cheaper and easier to get 🤷‍♂️ On another note the 2020 reminded me a little more of Four Roses also in a good way but not enough to justify the cost and hunt.

**TL;DR:** 14 >> 2020 > 2017 > 2013. They were all enjoyable but 2014 was the only one I would have considering buying.
