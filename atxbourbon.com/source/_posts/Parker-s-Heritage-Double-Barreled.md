## Parker's Heritage Double Barreled

**Age**: Blend of 13 and 15 year

**Proof**: 132.2

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose was amazing with rich sweet wood and brown sugar. The palate brought brown sugar, rye spice, leather and delicious rich wood. Shockingly this was not dry at all. It also very nice proof integration that let you know it was big and high proof without burning and a thick mouthfeel.

**Stars**: **4** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite

## Conclusion

Well it's time to hunt one down.

**TL;DR:** The best Parker's I've had and an all time standout
