{% asset_img image.jpg "Glenfiddich IPA Cask"%}

This is the first bottle in Glenfiddich's Experimental series and my second review in said series. This no age statement scotch was finished for an unspecified amount of time in IPA casks. I first tried it during a Matt Nathanson concert at Stubbs BBQ where I assumed I was going to be stuck drinking Jack and was pleasantly surprised. After [Fire and Cane](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/25/Review-45-Glenfiddich-Fire-and-Cane/) it seemed like a good time to grab a bottle of the IPA cask and see how it stacks up!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 86 Proof

**Color**: A pale gold

**Price**: $59.99

### Neat
**Nose**:  Strong, fresh apple notes with hints of pine and vanilla

**Taste**: Citrus and vanilla at the forefront with hints of pine in the background. A wonderful creamy mouthfeel

**Finish**: Short but with nice hoppy notes. This was the most IPA influenced part for me

### On a rock
**Nose**: Sweet vanilla and fresh apple notes, the nose remains strong but smooth over the ice

**Taste**: The ice actually detracted from the mouthfeel which is rare for me but the citrus notes shine through with sweet vanilla in the background

**Finish**: Very similar to the neat finish, a nice fresh hoppy note dominates

## Conclusion
I don't drink beer anymore but I used to be a big IPA fan(yes I wear plaid button downs and have a beard) so for me this is an awesome way to drink whiskey and get a bit of those fresh hoppy pine notes I loved in IPAs. This is fresh and bright scotch that is a bit more of a summer drinker or something to sip with dinner than a dram to keep you warm in the winter. While this bottle probably isn't for everyone, if you like Glenfiddich and IPAs I'd definitely encourage you to try it!

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
