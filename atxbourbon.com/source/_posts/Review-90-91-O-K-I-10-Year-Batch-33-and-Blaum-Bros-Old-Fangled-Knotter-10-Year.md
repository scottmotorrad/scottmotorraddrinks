I'm gearing up to review an Smooth Ambler Old Scout single barrel bourbon before they are all gone but I wanted to get a few other MGP bourbon reviews up first. I'd picked up samples of OKI 10 year Batch 33 and Blaum Bros Oldfangled Knotter 10 year during some local trades.

Both of these MGP sourced brands have a good bit of hype around them so let's see how they stack up!

## OKI 10 Year Batch 33
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 97.9 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Strong herbal notes with some oak and vanilla notes as well.

**Taste**: Intense spice notes alongside more herbs, oak and vanilla. It was also very dry.

**Finish**: Long and dry with herbal and baking spice notes.

## Blaum Bro Oldfangled Knotter
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 114.8 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Surprisingly delicate nose with honey, rye spice and oak notes.

**Taste**: Also a surprisingly thin mouthfeel for the proof, with lots of rye spice with some oak and just a bit of sweetness.

**Finish**: Long and very spicy.

## Conclusion
I was not a big fan of either bottle and while the extra proof was nice neither was better than the somewhat readily available [Boone County 1833](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/11/Reviews-29-Boone-County-1833/) or the pricey but present [Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/10/Reviews-72-73-Joseph-Magnus-Straight-Bourbon-and-Murray-Hill-Club/) for me. I won't be chasing either of these bottles. 

I still haven't reviewed an MGP straight bourbon that really blew my away but I'm optimistic for the SAOS.

### OKI 10 Year Batch 33
