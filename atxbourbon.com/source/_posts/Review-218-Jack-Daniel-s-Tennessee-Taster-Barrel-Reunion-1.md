For part 8 of the finished whiskey series we're looking at our first Tennessee whiskey with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Tasters' Selection Barrel Reunion #1, a Straight Tennessee Whiskey finished in red wine barrels. The shtick behind the Tennessee Tasters' Selection series is that Jack Daniel's master tasters pick some of their favorite expressions to release. In today's bourbon market who knows if that's true? Either way after getting into the JD Single Barrel series when I saw this little flask on the shelves I had to pick it up. I tend to like finished whiskies and red wine always seems to compliment bourbon bringing out more fruit notes without making it too sweet.

## Jack Daniel's Tennessee Tasters' Selection Barrel Reunion #1
**Age**: NAS with a 228 day finish

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Price**: $35 for a 375

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet bananas and red jam with vanilla and warm spice in the background.

**Taste**: Cherries, bananas and vanilla with hints of oak and smoke. Decent mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Short to medium length, sweet finish with caramel, banana and vanilla notes.

## Conclusion
This was super easy drinking with great fruit notes. It was a little light for me at only 90 proof though. I think a little more age and a little more proof would have given this some more complexity and improved the mouthfeel. It was a little pricey for what it is but given that it was a special release and came in a 375ml I don't feel bad about the price. It definitely met my expectations of taking the classic JD banana and vanilla profile and bringing out some nice red fruit notes. While it didn't hit the highs of the JD Heritage Barrel I'll probably pick up a future release to see what else they can do.

**TL;DR:** Surprisingly good; wish it was a little higher proof and a little older.
