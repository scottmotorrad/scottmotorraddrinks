For Week 12 of Sample Mountain I wanted to visit some weirder stuff. First up will be a peated bourbon from Kings County and since I am not particularly a fan of heavy peat or Kings County this will be exciting! Next up in a double oak rye from Peerless. Rebarreling can be hit or miss though I tend to like the results. Last up is Old Carter American Whiskey Batch 3 which I believe is a light whiskey from MGP.

## Kings County Peated Bourbon

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 90

### Neat
**Nose**: Young grain and acrid smoke.

**Taste**: Hot for 90 proof with more smoke and grain.

**Finish**: Long and lingering with fading heat and lasting smoke with hints of grain.

**Buy a bottle?** No.

## Peerless Double Oak Rye

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: Unknown (most bottles online are between 108-110)

### Neat
**Nose**: Herbs and spices with some proof sting and a fainter sweetness.

**Taste**: Really balanced between rye spice, oak notes and a vanilla sweetness. Very pleasant mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish 

**Buy a bottle?** Yes - if I was at the distillery and they had it stocked in the giftshop

## Old Carter American Whiskey Batch 3

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 138.1 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Potent with sweet caramel, oak and warm spice. The proof is present and almost too much.

**Taste**: Ethanol, heat, a nice caramel note toward the end. Astringent mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long, dry and hot. Deserty.

**Buy a bottle?** No

## Conclusion

The Kings County Peated was very much not for me. It was harsh and had an unusual finish. I'd buy Laphroaig 10 over this all day if I was looking for a peat fix.

The Peerless was surprisingly good but given the scarcity (gift shop releases) and price (34/200ml) I wouldn't seek it out. That said I'd happily pick up a 200ml bottle if I was visiting the gift shop. This is on brand for Peerless with a high quality but even higher priced release.

I had very low hopes for the Old Carter Batch 3 after [my previous experience with high proof MGP light whiskey](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/12/30/Reviews-191-194-The-Four-Horseman-MGP-Light-Whiskies/) and the disappointing Batch 3 of their bourbon. My low expectations were spot on. Whatever it is about these high proof MGP light whiskies just isn't for me. There are some nice caramels but they are lost in the hot mess.

**TL;DR:** Peerless solid but pricey, the other two were not for me.
