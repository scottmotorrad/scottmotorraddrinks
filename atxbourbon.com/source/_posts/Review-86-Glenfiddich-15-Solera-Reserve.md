This is the second in a 3 part series comparing some of Glenfiddich's mid range solera vat single malts: the [Select Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/04/Review-83-Glenfiddich-Select-Cask/), the [Reserve Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/12/Review-89-Glenfiddich-Reserve-Cask/) and the [15 year Solera Reserve](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/07/Review-86-Glenfiddich-15-Solera-Reserve/). I tasted all 3 of them together but not blindly.

The second entry is the single malt that started it all for me. While Johnnie Walker Black got me into scotch it was Glenfiddich 15 that brought me over to single malts way back in my college days. This excellent expression is aged in sherry, bourbon and new oak casks before being married in the solera vat.

## Review
**Age**: 15 years

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A medium gold 

**Price**: $62.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich dark fruit(not quite cherry or grapes), honey and oak notes dominate the nose though a couple drops of water tone them down a touch

**Taste**: More rich dark fruit and oak alongside a touch of spice that starts to pick up at the end. A couple drops of water brings the spice forward and uncovers a malt note. Surprisingly viscous mouthfeel for an 80 proofer.

**Finish**: A short to medium length finish with a nice balance of sweet honey and spice notes

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion
This old favorite is still delicious even if it has been ousted by their 18 year since I can afford better booze now. I still really enjoy the progression on this one from the sweet nose to the balanced finish and the oakiness with no bitterness. Overall this is a great bottle and an excellent entry point to single malt scotches. I'd love to try a higher proof bottling of this.

I also sipped on some [Basil Hayden's 10 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/05/Reviews-84-85-Ten-Year-Tater-Tasting-Heaven-s-Door-10-Year-and-Basil-s-Hayden-s-10-Year/)(the only other open 80 proof bottle I had) at the end to get a comparison on mouthfeel and this was way better. All three of these had a better mouthfeel in fact.
