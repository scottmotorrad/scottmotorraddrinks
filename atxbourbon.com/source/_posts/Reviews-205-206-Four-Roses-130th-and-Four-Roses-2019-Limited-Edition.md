[I reviewed the 2017 a long time ago](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/31/Review-37-Four-Roses-Small-Batch-Limited-Edition-2017/) but I am rereviewing it here alongside the 130th Anniversary and 2019 Limited Edition for the second to last part of my Four Roses series. 

I was a big fan of the 2017 the first time I had it so I am hoping it lives up compared to these two. I'd also heard a lot of good things about the 2019 LE and my first taste was great. The 130th was strong too but I don't think it was quite as good as the other two.

For this tasting I did another [blind tasting video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B7mDDTklqs0/) to pick a favorite and then sat down to write some more detailed notes.

## Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition 2017 
**Age**: 12-15 years

**Abv**: 108 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet dark fruit, brown sugar, rich baking spice and oak notes.

**Taste**: More sweet fruit with cherry and something else(plum maybe? I need to eat more fruits...), more warm baking spice, brown sugar and a bit of oak that's slightly tannic. Great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long and warm with more well balanced sweet, spice and oak notes. 

**Ranking**: #3

[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I always try to keep on my shelf

## Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition 130th Anniversary
**Age**: 10-16 years

**Abv**: 108.4 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet vanilla, grape or plum or some dark fruit that isn't a cherry, rye spice and subtler oak notes

**Taste**: Sweet fruit, the same one from the nose, rich oak and baking spice. Also a great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long warm finish with vanilla, oak and warm spice 

**Ranking**: #2

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition 2019
**Age**: 11-21 years

**Abv**: 112.6 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Potent but inviting with caramel, dark cherry and rich oak.

**Taste**: A medley of sweet fruit, che and warm spice notes with some oak and vanilla as well. The best mouthfeel of the bunch

**Finish**: Medium to long with more sweet fruit, vanilla and warm spice.

**Ranking**: #1

**4 Stars** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite

## Conclusion

These were all fantastic but the 2019 was a cut above. I managed to come up with some minor grips with each one. The oak was a touch too tannic on the '17, the finish was just 'good' on the '19 and I couldn't figure out what the fruit was on the '18. That said those were all minor and I really had to reach to get there.

Unfortunately I didn't get my hands on the '19 until I was already mostly done writing my [2019 Whiskey Awards](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/12/31/2019-Whiskey-Awards/) as it would have been a serious contender for the top spot. I am working on getting a backup bottle so here's hoping.

I am very excited for the final round doing a blind with the 2019 LE and some of my favorite picks from the series!

**TL;DR:** I need to eat more fruits, the 2019 stands out but they are all fantastic
