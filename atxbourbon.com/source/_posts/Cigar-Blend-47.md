I don't drink my Cigar Blend bottles as much as I used to but they are still some of my favorites. This batch in particular stood out to me in 2021 and it's getting low so it's time for a quick review and bottle kill.

## Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Batch 47 "Beatnik Breakfast"

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 127.56

### Neat

**Notes**: Old leather, dark chocolate, tobacco and charred oak are balanced by subtler brown sugar and cherry notes.

**Stars**: **4 Stars** - **Extraordinary whiskey:** An all time favorite

## Conclusion

This is one the best high proof Cigar Blend batches I've had and while it doesn't quite hit the same as the lower proof legends like 12 and 14 this is still an amazing bottle and drinks well below the proof. Now it's time to start looking for a new bottle to fill the spot on the shelf!


**TL;DR:** Still an all time favorite expression and this batch is a great one
