{% asset_img image.jpg "Nikka Whisky From The Barrel"%}

In August 2018 Nikka from the Barrel was finally released in the US! I had the good fortune of being able to grab a few bottles between the release and [Whiskey Advocate naming it whiskey of the year](http://whiskyadvocate.com/top20/2018/1-nikka-from-the-barrel/) killing the availability. SO let's see how the whiskey of the year stacks up!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 102.8 proof

**Color**: A medium deep gold

**Price**: $64.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Soft and sweet with floral honey, sweet pear and vanilla notes. 

**Taste**: Floral honey and pear notes with just a bit of caramel and baking spice. Excellent mouthfeel that I have come to associate with most 100-110 proof whiskies

**Finish**: Short, warm and sweet with caramel and baking spice notes, almost like a bourbon

### On a rock
**Nose**: Brighter than the neat nose but with the same sweet pear and floral honey notes

**Taste**: Clear pear and caramel notes with some citrus as well though the spice is gone. The mouthfeel holds up well to ice

**Finish**: Short and sweet without the warm spice from the neat finish but with the same caramel note

## Conclusion
Ah this was a hard one. When I nosed, tasted and mouthfelt(?) this whiskey I wanted to give it a 9 but then I was disappointed by the short and simple finish :( Still this is great whiskey, an awesome intro to higher proofs and I'm very glad I can get it in the US now! That said it wasn't my 2018 whiskey of the year or even in my top tier of whiskies. I wouldn't hunt for it but if you see it a retail it's definitely worth picking up.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

On a side note this whiskey on the rocks is my wife's favorite whiskey of all time. She prefers short finishes for some reason I have yet to understand.
