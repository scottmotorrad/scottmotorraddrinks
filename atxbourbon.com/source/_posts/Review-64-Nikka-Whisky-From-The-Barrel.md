{% asset_img image.jpg "Nikka Whisky From The Barrel"%}

In August 2018 Nikka from the Barrel was finally released in the US! I had the good fortune of being able to grab a few bottles between the release and [Whiskey Advocate naming it whiskey of the year](http://whiskyadvocate.com/top20/2018/1-nikka-from-the-barrel/) killing the availability. SO let's see how the whiskey of the year stacks up!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 102.8 proof

**Color**: A medium deep gold

**Price**: $64.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Soft and sweet with floral honey, sweet pear and vanilla notes. 

**Taste**: Floral honey and pear notes with just a bit of caramel and baking spice. Excellent mouthfeel that I have come to associate with most 100-110 proof whiskies

**Finish**: Short, warm and sweet with caramel and baking spice notes, almost like a bourbon

### On a rock
**Nose**: Brighter than the neat nose but with the same sweet pear and floral honey notes

**Taste**: Clear pear and caramel notes with some citrus as well though the spice is gone. The mouthfeel holds up well to ice

**Finish**: Short and sweet without the warm spice from the neat finish but with the same caramel note

## Conclusion
Ah this was a hard one. When I nosed, tasted and mouthfelt(?) this whiskey I wanted to give it a 9 but then I was disappointed by the short and simple finish :( Still this is great whiskey, an awesome intro to higher proofs and I'm very glad I can get it in the US now! That said it wasn't my 2018 whiskey of the year or even in my top tier of whiskies. I wouldn't hunt for it but if you see it a retail it's definitely worth picking up.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

On a side note this whiskey on the rocks is my wife's favorite whiskey of all time. She prefers short finishes for some reason I have yet to understand.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
