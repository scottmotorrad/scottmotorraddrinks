Dime Box Distillery out of Giddings, Texas has been releasing a lot of well aged MGP recently. I am pretty unclear on who they are or how they got all these barrels so I might head down there and see what's up but in the meantime I'll just drink them. One of my local groups, the Austin Dead Liver Society, picked this 9 year barrel. I was on the pick group but this barrel was my second choice. Let's see how it holds up now that it's bottled.

## Sixth Street Rye Whiskey

**Age**: 9 years

**Proof**: 119

**Price**: 115

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and spicy with vanilla frosting, rich oak and baking spice notes

**Taste**: Starts sweet with caramel and vanilla then spicier with baking and rye spice with some oak notes toward the end. Very viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long dry finish with fading vanilla then all oak and baking spice/

## Conclusion

Overall I am a fan of this rye and most of the older stuff Sixth Street has been putting out. Hopefully they have plenty of barrels and keep it up! That said, these picks are about the same quality as the 7 and 8 year MGP ryes coming out of Nashville Barrel Company. 

On another note I am not a fan of these guitar shaped bottles. It's harder to pour and doesn't fit well on my shelves. It's unclear if the guitar pick medallion can actually be used as a guitar pick.

**No score - I was on the pick group**


**TL;DR:** Another great MGP rye but didn't stand out vs the various 7-8 year NBCs ryes I have
