## New Riff Single Barrel Rye

**Age**: 4 years

**Proof**: 106.5

**Barrel #**: 2625

### Neat

**Notes**: Cinnamon and herbs. Syrupy sweetness. Slightly bitter both in an herbal and oak sense on the finish.


**Stars**: **0** - **Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options


**TL;DR:** Enjoyable but unremarkable. It took 5-6 years to kill it.
