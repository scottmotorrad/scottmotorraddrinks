The long awaited second Joseph Magnus pick from Oak Liquor Cabinet arrived yesterday so naturally I went and grabbed one but between the price and my good, but not amazing, experience with the regular [Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/02/10/Reviews-72-73-Joseph-Magnus-Straight-Bourbon-and-Murray-Hill-Club/) I was a little hesitant to buy multiples. So let's see if that was the right call:

## Joseph Magnus Oak Liquor Cabinet Pick 2019
**Age**: 12.5 years

**Abv**: 106.2 proof

**Color**: A medium copper 

**Price**: $99.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Warm and sweet with predominantly butterscotch and vanilla notes with a hint of warm spice.

**Taste**: Spicier than the nose but in a good way with more butter scotch and strong baking spice notes with vanilla and oak notes in the background. The mouthfeel is delightfully creamy.

**Finish**: Long oak forward and slightly dry with lingering brown sugar and warm spice notes.

### On a rock
**Nose**: All sweetness with rich brown sugar and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: This was like an extra buttery butterscotch candy with a very creamy mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: Cut very short by the ice this was just a quick note of butterscotch and then a bit of dryness.

## Conclusion
I'll start by saying that I'm definitely going to swing buy tomorrow to get a backup bottle if there are any left! I loved this both neat and on a rock which is great with the weather getting up into the 80s here in central Texas. 

This was very similar to the [Smooth Ambler Old Scout I have](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/19/Review-93-Smooth-Amber-Old-Scout-Straight-Bourbon/) but without the twinge of hot cinnamon at the end which gave it a small boost for me but the lack of cherry notes was a bit of a loss. These two are neck and neck so I'll have to do a blind tasting round to make a call.

These last two bottles have really brought me around on MGP bourbon and

[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I'd like to keep on my shelf
