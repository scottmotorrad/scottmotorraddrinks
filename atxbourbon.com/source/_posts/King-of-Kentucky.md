## King of Kentucky
**Age**: 15 years

**Abv**: 130.8 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Heat! Dry oak, brown sugar, chocolate, spice

**Taste**: Starts hot then dives into chocolate, caramel, rich oak, cinnamon and vanilla. Great mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length with a burst of heat then lingering caramel and spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: Tamed but not muted with brown sugar and oak notes.

**Taste**: Brighter and easier to drink with caramel, chocolate, oak and warm spice notes. Very viscous mouthfeel

**Finish**: Medium length finish with sweet caramel and hints of spice.

**2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Hot, great notes under the heat though, current prices are too crazy though
