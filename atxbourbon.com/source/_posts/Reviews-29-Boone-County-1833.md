Boone County 1833 is a sourced straight bourbon carrying a 12 year age statement which was intriguing. According to the bottle it is also small batch because why not? It's definitely distilled in Indiana though I am not 100% sure which distillery DSP-IN-1 is though I believe this is MGP. It is bottled in Kentucky and the marketing materials really focus on that and their Kentucky 'heritage' though I definitely respect that the bottle makes it clear that it is sourced. Anyways we aren't here to debate labeling so let's get into the tasting.

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 90.8 proof (45.4% ABV)

**Color**: A deep amber 

### Neat
**Nose**: Warm and sweet with brown sugar, vanilla and oak notes

**Taste**: Very smooth but a little thin. The oak notes come to the forefront with a hint of vanilla in the background

**Finish**: Dry almost like a red wine with a bit of lingering sweetness

### On a rock
**Nose**: Brighter and the vanilla rises to the top of the nose 

**Taste**: The ice really opens this one up bringing out a very nice tobacco note though it does further thin the mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: The dryness is gone and a sweet medium length finish with a hint of spice remains

## Conclusion 
I enjoyed the flavor profile on this one but the mouthfeel was a little thin and the notes weren't as strong as I would have liked. I'd love to get a chance to try the cask strength single barrel version of this.
