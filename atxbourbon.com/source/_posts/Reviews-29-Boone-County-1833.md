Boone County 1833 is a sourced straight bourbon carrying a 12 year age statement which was intriguing. According to the bottle it is also small batch because why not? It's definitely distilled in Indiana though I am not 100% sure which distillery DSP-IN-1 is though I believe this is MGP. It is bottled in Kentucky and the marketing materials really focus on that and their Kentucky 'heritage' though I definitely respect that the bottle makes it clear that it is sourced. Anyways we aren't here to debate labeling so let's get into the tasting.

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 90.8 proof (45.4% ABV)

**Color**: A deep amber 

### Neat
**Nose**: Warm and sweet with brown sugar, vanilla and oak notes

**Taste**: Very smooth but a little thin. The oak notes come to the forefront with a hint of vanilla in the background

**Finish**: Dry almost like a red wine with a bit of lingering sweetness

### On a rock
**Nose**: Brighter and the vanilla rises to the top of the nose 

**Taste**: The ice really opens this one up bringing out a very nice tobacco note though it does further thin the mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: The dryness is gone and a sweet medium length finish with a hint of spice remains

## Conclusion 
I enjoyed the flavor profile on this one but the mouthfeel was a little thin and the notes weren't as strong as I would have liked. I'd love to get a chance to try the cask strength single barrel version of this.

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar 

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
