Today is another vacation whiskey review as an excuse to day drink around the family. While I'm home I've been introducing my dad to a variety of affordable yet delicious bourbons and realized that I hadn't reviewed McKenna 10 year Single Barrel Bottled in Bond yet. I am torn between feeling like that name is buzzword bingo style nonsense or that it is checking all my favorite whiskey boxes. If only it was also a store pick :P. Anyways this bottle is from barrel #5254 which was barreled on 4/22/08. Onwards to the review!

## Review
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Color**: Medium to deep gold

**Price**: $31.99 in Utah

### Neat
**Nose**: Predominantly vanilla and oak notes with a bit of old leather

**Taste**: Starts with stronger oak notes which give way to sweet butterscotch and warm spice. Excellent, viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long and warm with more spice and butterscotch notes.

### On a rock
**Nose**: Clean and sweet with vanilla and caramel notes

**Taste**: A sweet caramel note takes the lead on ice with subtler but clear oak and baking notes. The mouthfeel was still great.

**Finish**: Slightly shorter but still long and warm with a balance of caramel and baking spice


## Conclusion
This is great bourbon and an amazing value,  it's right there with [1792 Small Batch](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/09/Review-40-1792-Small-Batch/) for me for daily drinkers and is a great introduction to higher proof bourbons for folks looking to move beyond 86 proofers. All that said this whiskey embodies a whiskey that does everything right but lacks something special to put it over into the 9 or 10 range.

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

[**Great**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/great-value/) - A great deal, I'd buy it again
