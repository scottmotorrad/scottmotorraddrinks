{% asset_img image.jpg "George T Stagg"%}

We hit the Roosevelt Room tonight after dinner and saw George T Stagg on the menu and knew what I had to do(also they were out of ER17 and Saz 18 which made it easy). After quickly Googling the proof this appears to be the 2017. George T Stagg is the big brother so to speak of Stagg Jr, a personal favorite, and part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. 

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 129.2 proof (64.6% ABV)

**Color**: A vibrant gold and red

### Neat
**Nose**: Baking spice, brown sugar and oak, sort of like the Great British Bake Off gone off the rails but with enough alcohol to know it's going to be good

**Taste**: Hot! But good. Delightful notes of vanilla caramel and oak with hints of spice and dark fruit, maybe cherries?

**Finish**: Shorter than I expected as the sweet and oak fade to a medium baking spice and just a bit of heat

### On a rock
**Nose**: Amazing all the notes from the neat nose are still present even if slightly mellowed

**Taste**: The ice smooths out any lingering heat and while the oak backs off a bit the spice more than steps up to take it's place

**Finish**: About the same as neat, sweet fades spice lingers and just a bit of heat to lead you into the next sip

## Conclusion
This whiskey was extremely good. Sure it was a little hot especially neat but the depth of the flavor more than makes up from it. This makes 3 down and 2 to go, I'm still on the hunt for ER17 and Saz 18 to round of the BTAC, but the journey has been amazing so far. I'd definitely love to pick up a bottle at some point but I doubt I'll have the chance.
