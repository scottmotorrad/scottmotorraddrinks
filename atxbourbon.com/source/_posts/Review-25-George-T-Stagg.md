{% asset_img image.jpg "George T Stagg"%}

We hit the Roosevelt Room tonight after dinner and saw George T Stagg on the menu and knew what I had to do(also they were out of ER17 and Saz 18 which made it easy). After quickly Googling the proof this appears to be the 2017. George T Stagg is the big brother so to speak of Stagg Jr, a personal favorite, and part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. 

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 129.2 proof (64.6% ABV)

**Color**: A vibrant gold and red

### Neat
**Nose**: Baking spice, brown sugar and oak, sort of like the Great British Bake Off gone off the rails but with enough alcohol to know it's going to be good

**Taste**: Hot! But good. Delightful notes of vanilla caramel and oak with hints of spice and dark fruit, maybe cherries?

**Finish**: Shorter than I expected as the sweet and oak fade to a medium baking spice and just a bit of heat

### On a rock
**Nose**: Amazing all the notes from the neat nose are still present even if slightly mellowed

**Taste**: The ice smooths out any lingering heat and while the oak backs off a bit the spice more than steps up to take it's place

**Finish**: About the same as neat, sweet fades spice lingers and just a bit of heat to lead you into the next sip

## Conclusion
This whiskey was extremely good. Sure it was a little hot especially neat but the depth of the flavor more than makes up from it. This makes 3 down and 2 to go, I'm still on the hunt for ER17 and Saz 18 to round of the BTAC, but the journey has been amazing so far. I'd definitely love to pick up a bottle at some point but I doubt I'll have the chance. 

**9** - I wish I could buy a bottle! 

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
