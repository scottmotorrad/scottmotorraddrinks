The folks at [Bold Move Beverages](https://www.instagram.com/boldmovebevs/) were generous and gave me a 4 pack of their new [Cold Brooze Original Black](https://boldmovebeverages.com/). Cold Brooze is made here in Austin from American whiskey, cold brew coffee and natural vanilla. Given that whiskey and cold brew are my favorite beverages I was very excited.

The coffee is the star of the show here with deep flavors. The whiskey comes through nicely though clearly in a supporting role and the vanilla is relatively subtle. I tried this both right out of the can and poured over ice and definitely preferred it extra cold. It was a great way to stay cool while griddling up breakfast on the Blackstone. The 0 sugar is also a big plus for me. Overall I really enjoyed this and look forward to picking up some more.
