Blood Oath is a divisive series of sourced bourbons from Luxco. Between the unknown sourcing, inclusion of finished whiskeys and fancy packaging these bottles have been subject to a lot of hate and a lot of tatering(full disclosure: I am on the tatering side here). This year's relase, Pact 5, is a blend of 3 bourbons: a 13 year old, an 11 year old wheater and an 8 year old finished in rum barrels for an undisclosed amount of time. So let's see if it lives up to the hate or the hype!

## Blood Oath Pact 5
**Age**: A blend of an 8 year, 11 year and 13 year

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $99.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet vanilla and banana notes I often associate with rum with a subtle nuttiness.

**Taste**: Less vanilla than the nose with caramel notes, more rummy bananas and that hint of slight nuttiness alongside a solid mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with nice vanilla and caramel notes. I don't know where the rum notes went though.

## Conclusion
I really liked this one and it reminded me of a bananas foster. It's definitely a dessert whiskey for me alongside things like Barrell Dovetail and [High West A Mid Winter Night's Dram](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/01/04/Review-61-High-West-A-Mid-Winter-Night-s-Dram-Act-6-Scene-5/). Overall it is a great whiskey(assuming you like finished whiskies) that's probably a little on the high side pricewise but I'd happily pick up another bottle at retail. I think it edges out Dovetail in taste but costs nontrivially more ($85 vs $100) so it's a bit of a toss up if you are looking for a rum finished whiskey.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

Looking forward, I am still trying to track down a bottle or at the very least some samples of Pact 1 to do a comparison of the Pacts in the near future and I am reworking my scale to differentiate more between the growing number of 7 and 8 point reviews.

You can also follow me on [Instagram(@atxbourbon)](https://www.instagram.com/atxbourbon/) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottmotorraddrinks/) to keep up with these reviews and my other whiskey-centric adventures.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
