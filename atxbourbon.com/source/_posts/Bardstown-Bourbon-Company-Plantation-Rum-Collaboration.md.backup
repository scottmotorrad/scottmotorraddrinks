Bardstown Bourbon Company was kind enough to send me a sample of their collaboration with Plantation Rum. I tried both the rum and bourbon neat as well as in cocktails.

The bourbon is a 10 year old from Tennessee weighing in at 104 proof. It reminds me of a peanut butter and banana sandwich with notes of rye bread, nuts, funkiness, banana and some oak. It was tasty neat and made an amazing old fashioned where the rum influence especially the funky banana came through nicely.

The rum was very sweet with a sugary sweetness, some banana and ethanol. The dark and stormy was great, especially for sitting outside on a hot day. The fancy cocktail glass they sent me was perfect for the occasion.

Thanks again to the folks at Bardstown!
