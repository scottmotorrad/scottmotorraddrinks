I don't drink a lot of Irish whiskey but when I do it's usually Green or Red Spot.

## Green Spot

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 80

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet and bright with honey and malt notes and hints of apple. Watery mouthfeel. Short clean finish with a touch of spice. The anemic proof underperforms at the price point and the nice, if simple, flavors carry this.

**Stars**: **1** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Red Spot

**Age**: 15 years

**Proof**: 92 - also NCF

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is rich with harvest notes of apple, cinnamon, holiday spices and oak. Palate dark dried fruit, apple pie and baking spices plus more oak.  The finish is medium length with lingering oak and spice with subtle dried fruit notes. Solid mouthfeel for the proof and great proof integration. It tastes bigger than 92 proof and has no heat or sting.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Green Spot is nice but hard to justify the price. Red Spot is a winner.
