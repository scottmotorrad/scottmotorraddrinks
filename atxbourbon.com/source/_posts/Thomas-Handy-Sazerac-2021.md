## Thomas H Handy Sazerac 2021
**Age**: 6 years 4 months

**Proof**: 129.5

### Neat

**Nose**: Rye spice, vanilla cream, subtle oak and a bit of cinnamon.

**Taste**: More rye spice, sweet herbs, licorice, rich oak, baking spice, vanilla cream and cinnamon. Luscious mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Very long, warm finish with rye spice, oak, some herbal notes, vanilla extract and that cinnamon.

## Conclusion

This was my only big Buffalo Trace score in 2021 but I was very happy with it. The rye spice, herbal and sweet notes were well balanced if tending towards the spicy side. I preferred 2020 in a side by side but 2021 was close and definitely a return to form after 2019.

**TL;DR:** Awesome bottle, not quite at the level 2020 but a big step up from 2019

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle
