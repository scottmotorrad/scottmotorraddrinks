This is a Camp Nelson A sample I got a while back that I am finally getting around to tasting.

## Russell's Reserve 4 On the Floor

**Age**: ??

**Proof**: 110

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet and funky. Reminds me of WB Saffell. The nose has a lot of caramel and a hint of salinity. The palate brings more caramel, oak, Turkey funk and a good bit of spice. The finish is long and warm with fading oak then lingering spice and vanilla. The proof integration and mouthfeel are solidly what I would expect from a Rusellâ€™s pick.


**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


**TL;DR:** A solid, funky Russell's pick
