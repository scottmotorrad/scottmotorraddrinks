For part 3 of the [Woodford series](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/woodford-reserve/) we are going to move away the nonstandard mashbills and take a look at their flagship bourbon. In my experience Woodford Reserve is a staple of surviving Delta flights and dive bars but it's also a solid bourbon. It's a NAS batch of pot still and column still whiskey, has a 'high rye' mashbill, is aged in climate controlled warehouses and is cut to Woodford's signature 90.4 proof with limestone water. It's priced right around the same as one of my go to low cost drinkers: [1792 Small Batch](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/09/Review-40-1792-Small-Batch/).

## Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 90.4 proof

**Mashbill**: 72% wheat, 18% rye and 10% malt  

**Price**: $27.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet vanilla, baking spice and herbal notes.

**Taste**: Rich caramel and present but not overwhelming baking spice. Good mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium length with warm spice, more of the herbal note from the nose.

## Conclusion

This was a good bourbon especially for the price point and availability. The extra spiciness and herbal note from the rye are nice if you like rye grain flavors. If 1792 SmB was too sweet or simple for you this would be a reasonable jump. This is definitely better overall than the Woodford Wheat Whiskey but the Wheat Whiskey was more unique. I preferred this to the Oat Grain which only makes me feel worse about the high price tag on that one :/

Overall I think Woodford is making some solid bourbon but I really want them to release a higher proof, aged stated expression. Next up will be their Rye Whiskey!

**TL;DR:** Good bourbon, standard high rye profile, doesn't stand out
