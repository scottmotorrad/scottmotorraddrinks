I'm in Seattle this week for a work trip and good whiskey is stupid expensive here so it seemed like a good time to review something more affordable. Evan Williams Bottled in Bond seemed like the best bet so without further ado let's get to the review!

## Review
**Age**: 4 years

**Abv**: 100 proof 

**Color**: A medium amber

**Price**: $21.99 (with all the crazy Seattle taxes)

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich oak and caramel notes with peanuts and just a bit of harshness 

**Taste**: More oak but a little too much with lesser caramel and vanilla notes. Oddly thin mouthfeel for 100 proof

**Finish**: Medium length and a little harsh with peanuts, oak and caramel 

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice cures the harshness and leaves the caramel and oak notes intact

**Taste**: It starts reasonable but with an odd bitterness later on. Notes of vanilla and caramel

**Finish**: Shorter and oaky with just a bit of sweetness

### With Diet Coke
**Nose**: Cola and oak with a bit of vanilla

**Taste**: Starts all cola which fades as the oak notes ramp up 

**Finish**: A nice blend of cola and oak

## Conclusion
The nose on this improved significantly with resting. When I cracked the bottle and poured the first dram it was very harsh. Overall I was all little disappointed with this one and found it bitter and a bit harsh. It makes an excellent mixer, especially given the proof and price.

### Quality
**3** - Better than not drinking whiskey but just barely

### Value based on what I paid
**Fair** - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
