After my second time tasting Wild Turkey Master’s Keep 17 Year Bottled in Bond I decided I wanted a bottle. Thankfully a member of a local bourbon group gave me a tip on where to find a bottle at retail just a short drive out of town.

## Review #247: Wild Turkey Master's Keep 17 Year Bottled in Bond 
**Age**: 17 years

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Price**: $170

### Neat
**Nose**: Cherry, more cherry, vanilla, caramel, warm spices, faint oak

**Taste**: Cherry syrup, caramel apple, baking spices, almost no oak taste. Great mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Very long, if subtler, finish with baking spice, oak, caramel and smokey notes

## Conclusion

That was tasty, very sweet for Turkey and surprisingly bright for something 17 years old. I really do think it has a different flavor profile from modern, higher entry proof Turkey. This might be a plus to folks who aren't big fans of the current Turkey profile but I doubt they are buying a $170 Master's Keep.

I’ve blinded this twice now [once against a line up of top shelf Turkey bottlings](https://www.instagram.com/p/CByM28kHtUq/) and a second time [against Decades](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/04/04/Review-101-Wild-Turkey-Master-s-Keep-Decades/). I put in last in the first blind but I did have it come out on top of Decades. I’ve tasted it against a handful of off the shelf Russell’s Reserve picks and it beat them out though not by as much as I would have hoped. I think this is the best Master’s Keep release yet but that the price point is hard to justify. Also I am relatively confident this is chill filtered which is disappointing for a premium release.

**TL;DR:** Great bottle, crazy price; I'd probably buy another one if they sit around for a while then go on sale like previous MK bottles


[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'd like to have at home

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
