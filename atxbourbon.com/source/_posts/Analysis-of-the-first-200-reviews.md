I'm taking a short break from drinking for the start of the year and I just finished review #200 so I figured this would be a good time to do an analysis of my first 200 reviews.

## High Level Stats

**Average**: 7.09

**Std Dev**: 1.7

**Mode**: 8

**Median**: 7

**Max**: 10

**Min**: 1

**Distribution**:

1. 2
2. 3
3. 5
4. 5
5. 13
6. 26
7. 44
8. 46
9. 35
10. 5

I'm pretty happy with those numbers though it does reveal that I fall into the same behavior as a lot of other internet reviewers and tend to give out a lot of 8s even if they were neck and neck with 7s. I feel like 5/200 for perfect 10s is pretty reasonable with top 3% being a good approximation of the best whiskies I've reviewed. Clearly there aren't many 1-4 reviews and I am fine with that since I am not going to buy much whiskey I don't care for at this point and I don't like to spend too much of my creative time being negative about things.

The 10 point reviews went to a distillery release of High West Rendezvous Rye aged for 4 years and 7 months in port pipes(basically MWND but higher proof and more port), 2018 Old Rip Van Winkle, Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Batch 12, 2019 William Larue Weller and Remus Volstead Reserve. I pretty much stand by all of these and haven't given up hopes of finding that High West release.

*Quick note that when I moved to my current scale and account I did update the reviews on atxbourbon.com but not the reviews posted on Reddit as u/scottmotorrad and the above distribution is based on the updated scores. Of course discussing the numbers without looking at the scale doesn't tell a very complete picture so that's up next.

I am very happy with the breakdown into 2 parts 1 for quality and 1 for value. 

I think 10 points might still be too many though. I've considered something like the [New York Times restaurant scale](https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/dining) that lumps everything from ok down into the 0 star bucket so from 5 down on my current scale and then has 1-4 stars for good to extraordinary. I do like reserving a number at the bottom for things that are outright bad though so it doesn't quite work for me. Moving to a 7 or 8 point scale seems counter intuitive compared to a 5 or 10 point and 5 feels just a little too tight. Anyways I'm going to keep thinking about it, if you have any suggestions please send them my way!

**Canadian Rye sold as Straight Rye whiskey in the US is bucketed as Rye*

Not a lot of surprises here for me. I like bourbon a lot and drink it the most so naturally most of my reviews were bourbon. With my tastes tending towards higher proofs these days and the new tariffs I just don't see myself getting back into scotch all that much. I'll still drink it from time to time especially for things like the r/scotch Wardhead pick and definitely when I am in Europe and can get cask strength stuff at a reasonable cost. American and Canadian whiskey that are not straight bourbon or straight rye are generally not for me and that shows in the stats.

**TL;DR** The first 200 reviews went well. Looking forward to 200 more!
