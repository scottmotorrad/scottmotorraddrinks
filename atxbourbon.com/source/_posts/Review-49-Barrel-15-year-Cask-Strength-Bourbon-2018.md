This is [Forbes 2018 American Whiskey of the Year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fredminnick/2018/11/16/best-american-whiskey-how-an-underdog-won-2018/#7e50cc1d63c9) and I got caught up in the tater hype :) Thankfully I was able to get this at near retail. It's a blend of bourbons from Tennessee(Dickel for sure), Indiana (99% sure it's MGP) and somewhere in Kentucky(no idea). So let's take a break from High West and review another American craft blender!

## Review
**Age**: 15 years

**Abv**: 105.1 Proof

**Color**: A deep amber

**Price**: Expensive AF... (~$220)

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with toasted marshmallow and chocolate notes, very reminiscent of well aged Dickel

**Taste**: Wow! Very complex flavor profile. The Dickel marshmallow and chocolate notes are strong but there are also some layered caramel and vanilla notes along with oak lingering in the background. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, very nice. I'm not sure I'm qualified to pick out all the notes in this one :)

**Finish**: Long and warm with more marshmallow, chocolate and oak plus a bit of lingering baking spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: Very muted by the ice with faint chocolate notes

**Taste**: Smoother and sweeter with more oak than neat. Brighter as well. Oddly for me, I prefer the mouthfeel neat.

**Finish**: A little shorter and the spice is quenched. All toasted marshmallow and oak.

## Conclusion
This was excellent but man was it pricey and it's hard to find. I wouldn't hunt it given the number of other excellent, cheaper and more accessible bourbons but if I came across it at retail I'd probably pick up an extra bottle.

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
