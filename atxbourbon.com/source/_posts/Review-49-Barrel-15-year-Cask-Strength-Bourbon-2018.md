This is [Forbes 2018 American Whiskey of the Year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fredminnick/2018/11/16/best-american-whiskey-how-an-underdog-won-2018/#7e50cc1d63c9) and I got caught up in the tater hype :) Thankfully I was able to get this at near retail. It's a blend of bourbons from Tennessee(Dickel for sure), Indiana (99% sure it's MGP) and somewhere in Kentucky(no idea). So let's take a break from High West and review another American craft blender!

## Review
**Age**: 15 years

**Abv**: 105.1 Proof

**Color**: A deep amber

**Price**: Expensive AF... (~$220)

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet with toasted marshmallow and chocolate notes, very reminiscent of well aged Dickel

**Taste**: Wow! Very complex flavor profile. The Dickel marshmallow and chocolate notes are strong but there are also some layered caramel and vanilla notes along with oak lingering in the background. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, very nice. I'm not sure I'm qualified to pick out all the notes in this one :)

**Finish**: Long and warm with more marshmallow, chocolate and oak plus a bit of lingering baking spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: Very muted by the ice with faint chocolate notes

**Taste**: Smoother and sweeter with more oak than neat. Brighter as well. Oddly for me, I prefer the mouthfeel neat.

**Finish**: A little shorter and the spice is quenched. All toasted marshmallow and oak.

## Conclusion
This was excellent but man was it pricey and it's hard to find. I wouldn't hunt it given the number of other excellent, cheaper and more accessible bourbons but if I came across it at retail I'd probably pick up an extra bottle.

[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I'd like to keep on my shelf

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
