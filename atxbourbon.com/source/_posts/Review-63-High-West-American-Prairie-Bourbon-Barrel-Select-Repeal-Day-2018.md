For Repeal Day 2018 High West released a barrel select American Prairie finished for 2 years and 1 month in the 36th Vote Barrel Aged Manhattan barrels which were originally used to age rye whiskey. My folks went to the party and grabbed a couple bottles, one of which ended up being a gift for me! I got to try my dad's bottle back in Utah and have already done some damage to this one so let's get to the review.

## Review
**Age**: 2-13 years and then finished for 2 years and 1 month

**Abv**: 101.98 proof

**Color**: A reddish amber

**Price**: $49.99

### Neat
**Nose**: The Manhattan finish is clear from the nose with the prominent dark cherry and herbal notes backed by a subtle vanilla.

**Taste**: Excellent mouthfeel and rich dark cherry notes with tamer herbal and oak notes.

**Finish**: Longer than the regular bottling with warm spice and vanilla

### On a rock
**Nose**: A little muted by the ice but still very Manhattany with the cherry note standing out and the herbal and vanilla notes in the background

**Taste**: Even better than it was neat with a more viscous mouthfeel and more balance between the cherry, herbs and oak. The vanilla for the nose is also there.

**Finish**: Very similar to the neat finish if a hair shorter

## Conclusion
The finishing and higher proof definitely made this more interesting than it's [usual expression](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/05/Review-47-High-West-American-Prairie-Bourbon-2017/). It's very flavorful, has a great mouthfeel and I'd be happy to use this on the rocks as a replacement for a Manhattan or to sip neat. Overall it's a great bourbon and if I could grab another bottle at retail I definitely would.

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

This will be the last entry in my High West series and I'll do a little wrap up post in the next few days covering the whiskey line up and the distillery experience.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
