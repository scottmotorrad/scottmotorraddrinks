For part 12 of the finished whiskies series we are back to High West rye whiskey but taking a step down from the Rendezvous Rye barrel selects to look at the more readily available Double Rye! barrel selects.

This particular bottle was from 2018, finished in gin barrels for 7 months and was a selection from the distributor for "High West Fans of Texas!" so that's fun. This caught my eye since gin is my preferred clear spirit though I primarily drink it in cocktails. I've only had barrel aged gin a handful of times but I was curious to see how it would mingle with the rye whiskey notes.

## Review #225: High West Double Rye! Barrel Select Gin Finish
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 102.8 proof

**Price**: $50

### Neat
**Nose**: Gin botanicals, more gin botanicals and some faint rye spice.

**Taste**: Bright and rich with herbs, gin, warm spice and faint oak and vanilla notes. Very nice mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long and warm with spice, botanical and vanilla notes. 

## Conclusion

Well that was something different. I liked it but if you don't like gin this is definitely not for you. The gin overwhelmed the whiskey on the nose but became less prominent as it went. I tend to find that these High West Double Ryes have a lot of herbal notes anyway so maybe some of that was from the whiskey. Negronis and Boulevardiers are some of my favorite cocktails and this unique gin/whiskey hybrid makes a killer spirit base for one of those.

**TL;DR:** Really interesting, lots of gin influence, great in a Boulevardier
