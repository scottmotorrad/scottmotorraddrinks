I'm taking a break from my Woodford series since my fellow Austin Bourbon Hunter [@texasdrinker](https://www.instagram.com/texasdrinker/) nabbed a bottle of Cornerstone on Friday and brought it over for a tasting. We did a blind taste off against Russell's Reserve Single Barrel Rye as u/rarebird101 suggested and I threw in a couple of my favorite ryes as well.

This was [a single blind tasting(meaning we knew which ryes were on the table but had no idea which was which)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1SJ9WTnlZ4/) and we'd both had a drink already that day, Whistle Pig 10 year for me and 2017 GTS for him.

First up are the raw notes I took during the blind tasting. Over the rest of the weekend I sat down with each whiskey 1 by 1 and wrote some more detailed notes which are included below.

## Follow up tasting notes and ratings
### Cornerstone
**Nose:** Soft with vanilla, caramel and  rye spice notes with some faint herbal notes in the background.

**Taste:** Rich herbs, caramel, vanilla, rye spice and a bit of cherry at the end. Very nice mouthfeel.

**Finish:** Medium length finish with rye spice, black pepper and a slight, longer lingering burn in my throat.

Overall sitting down with a 2oz sample of this didn't really change much. I was able to find that cherry note Rarebird101 and others have talked about but the finish was still not doing all that much for me. There was a bit of black pepper and a slight burn that lingered in my throat but I don't think of that as a long finish. 

[**7**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/7/) - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money

### Kentucky Owl Batch 1
**Nose:** A very nice blend of rye spice, dark fruit and sweet honey. 

**Taste:** More rye spice, dark cherries, cinnamon and a thick mouthfeel

**Finish:** A long spicy finish with lingering dark cherry, rich oak and cinnamon

I enjoyed this during the blind but I enjoyed it a good bit more outside the blind. Either way it's an excellent whiskey and while the price increase and quality slip on batch 2 are disappointing I'm still glad I grabbed this bottle at MSRP. 

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

[**Fair**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/fair-value/) - Worth the money, happy with my purchase

### Willet 6
**Nose:** Soft earthy nose with rich herbal notes and a faint sweetness.

**Taste:** The taste starts off really sweet but then backs off to more herbal and slightly spicy notes. Top notch mouthfeel.

**Finish:** Medium to long with more subtle spic, herbs and faint sweetness.

I've already [blinded this against a few other Willet ryes](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzWOJ2GnqZw/) and I preferred the 4 year small batch to the 6 year single barrel. I tried them again side by side, eyes wide open and still preferred the 4 year. It has a lot more dark fruit notes which is a huge plus for me. The 6 year is subtle, in a good way, herbal and slightly sweet with a bit of spice on the finish. I still really enjoyed it but I won't be seeking out another one though I am looking forward to the 5 year small batches dropping soonish.

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money

### Russell's Reserve Single Barrel Rye LL/GA240348
**Nose:** Strong nose without being harsh with rich oak, rye bread, herbal and vanilla notes.

**Taste:** Rich oak, sweet caramel, cherry and tobacco notes are backed by a very nice mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Very long finish with tons of rye spice that aren't quite balanced by the hints of sweet caramel and tobacco.

I'd only had RR SiB rye once before this blind and was very underwhelmed but this bottle was fantastic. I'm left wondering if I just managed to grab a honey barrel this time. I guess the only way to find out is to drink several more! Rye whiskey still isn't my favorite but barely legal ryes like this are helping bring me around.

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

[**Great**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/great-value/) - A great deal, I'd buy it again

## Conclusion
First off these were all great whiskies but I'm not sure I am top shelf rye guy. In the rye world high age statements seem to matter even less to me than they do in bourbon or scotch. I enjoyed all 4 of these whiskies but the 2 youngest ryes were my favorites.  I had a lot of fun doing this blind tasting and sitting down with these whiskies after the fact and am still determined to find an unfinished rye that really blows me away.
