Smooth Ambler generated a lot of hype with their MGP sourced single barrel line, disappointed with their own distillate and recently released a new Old Scout Single Barrel Select, this time sourced from Dickel. I tend to like well aged Dickel well enough and loved the [MGP Old Scout](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/19/Review-93-Smooth-Amber-Old-Scout-Straight-Bourbon/) so I was cautiously optimistic for dram. Let's see if it lives up to the name!

## Smooth Ambler Old Scout Single Barrel Select
**Age**: 13 years

**Abv**: 99 proof

**Color**: A medium amber 

**Price**: $64.99

**Batch**: 13601

### Neat
**Nose**: Very sweet with chocolate milk powder, toasted marshmallow and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: More chocolate and marshmallow but with a little bit warm spice and oak.

**Finish**: Medium to long finish where chocolate fades to warm spice and oak.

### On a rock
**Nose**: The chocolate and marshmallow motes are still there but subdued and I finally get some of that famous Dickel vitamin note

**Taste**: The ice really brings out the vitamin note though the mouthfeel was quite nice

**Finish**: Short and sweet with a bit of chocolate.

## Conclusion
Taking this by itself it was quite good neat, especially the nose. It reminded me a lot of the [Dickel sourced Barrell single barrels](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/08/25/Review-7-Barrell-Bourbon-Single-Barrel-Select/) but a bit better though not as good as the [Barrell Craft Spirits 15 year](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/08/Review-49-Barrel-15-year-Cask-Strength-Bourbon-2018/). I don't usually get vitamin from most good Dickel but the ice brought that way out here which was disappointing.

On the other hand when I compared it too the MGP Old Scout Single Barrel the Select was left wanting. The mouthfeel and the finish were significantly better with the MGP juice.

Overall I enjoyed the bottle even if it didn't live up to its namesake though I won't be tracking down another bottle right now though I'd be interested in trying the next batch or a store pick.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
