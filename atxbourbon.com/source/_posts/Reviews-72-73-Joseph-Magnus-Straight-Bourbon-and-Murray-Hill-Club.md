{% asset_img image.jpg "Joseph Magnus Bourbon"%}

The unfortunate weather in Austin this last week has a little silver lining in that it has given me plenty of time to drink whiskey and write about it! I've been holding off on the last couple ounces of my bottle of Murray Hill Club to write a review and since I am all about side by sides now I decied to grab a mini of Joesph Magnus bourbon to review with it. I've had the Magnus once or twice at a bar and drank a good about the Moonshine barrel select Magnus so I am looking forward to drinking in a more tasting friendly setting. So let's see how these pricey, sourced bourbons stack up!

## Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Color**: Deeper amber 

**Price**: $99.99 (21.99 for this 100ml bottle I bought)

### Neat
**Nose**: Slightly harsh with citrus and oak then vanilla and baking spice.

**Taste**: A nice mouthfeel with more citrus and oak with caramel, warm spice and vanilla notes.

**Finish**: Short to medium finish that its a bit hot with cinnamon, oak and baking spice notes.

### On a rock
**Nose**: Subdued with soft citrus and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: This ice really opens this up with the bright citrus note in the forefront with vanilla and oak supporting. Sort of like a woody orange creamsicle. The mouthfeel is also improved with a bit of ice.

**Finish**: Short, soft and sweet finish with more fading citrus and vanilla.

## Murray Hill Club Batch 11 Bottle No 179
**Age**: A blend of 10 year light whiskey and 13 year and 20 year bourbon

**Abv**: 103 proof

**Color**: Slightly less deep amber

**Price**: $99.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Surprisingly soft with brown sugar, honey, vanilla and toasted oak notes.

**Taste**: An excellent mouthfeel with rich notes of honey, vanilla, brown sugar, and toasted oak with milder vanilla and warm spice notes. 

**Finish**: Long, warm and sweet with honey and vanilla notes that fade to warm spices.

### On a rock
**Nose**: Subdued with honey and faint oak notes

**Taste**: The mouthfeel holds up well with the ice. The ice sort of brightens up the whiskey bringing down the toasted oak and spice notes and bringing out a slightly fruity note, green apple perhaps? 

**Finish**: Still long warm and sweet with honey and vanilla and less of a fade to spice than neat.

## Conclusion
It looks like an unpopular opinion but I am huge fan of the Murray Hill Club and will definitely be picking up the next batch and keeping an eye out for the special release. The Joseph Magnus bourbon on the other hand was underwhelming, though good, and I am very glad I bought the 100ml instead of picking up a full bottle as I just can't justify the price point. The citrus and vanilla notes were nice for sure but it a little hot for me neat and if I am drinking it over ice there are so many cheaper and delicious options. 

On a side note I want to try blending some of my [High West 14 year Light Whiskey](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/31/Review-56-High-West-Light-Whiskey-Batch-3/) with an extra aged bourbon now to see if I can approximate the Murray Hill Club.

### Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon
**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

### Murray Hill Club Batch 11 Bottle No 179

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
