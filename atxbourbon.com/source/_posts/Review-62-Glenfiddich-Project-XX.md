{% asset_img image.jpg "Project XX"%}

Today we're picking up the Glenfiddich experimental series with the Project XX. This experiment involved 20 folks each choosing a cask from one of Glenfiddich's warehouses and then blending them all together. This sounds like a really high budget version of an infinity bottle but let's see how it stacks up!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 94 proof

**Color**: A deeper gold

**Price**: $67.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Light and sweet with pear and floral honey notes

**Taste**: Warmer and fuller than the nose but still sweet with some spice perhaps pear and cinnamon? Nice, viscous mouthfeel

**Finish**: Longer than I expected as the sweet pear fades into spice and a bit of oak

### On a rock
**Nose**: Very light with just hints of floral honey

**Taste**: Candied pear notes and vanilla without any of the spice from the neat taste. The mouthfeel is still very solid

**Finish**: Medium length with pear and warmer spice notes

## Conclusion
This was a good dram but it didn't really standout to me. The Fire and Cane and IPA Cask each tasted very unique whereas this tasted like a pretty generic Speyside scotch. It was sweet and fruity with a little something more to it. The higher proof was a nice treat as most Glenfiddichs are in the 80s but overall I preferred the other two experimental series. That said another solid and affordable scotch from Glenfiddich.
