{% asset_img image.jpg "Project XX"%}

Today we're picking up the Glenfiddich experimental series with the Project XX. This experiment involved 20 folks each choosing a cask from one of Glenfiddich's warehouses and then blending them all together. This sounds like a really high budget version of an infinity bottle but let's see how it stacks up!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 94 proof

**Color**: A deeper gold

**Price**: $67.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Light and sweet with pear and floral honey notes

**Taste**: Warmer and fuller than the nose but still sweet with some spice perhaps pear and cinnamon? Nice, viscous mouthfeel

**Finish**: Longer than I expected as the sweet pear fades into spice and a bit of oak

### On a rock
**Nose**: Very light with just hints of floral honey

**Taste**: Candied pear notes and vanilla without any of the spice from the neat taste. The mouthfeel is still very solid

**Finish**: Medium length with pear and warmer spice notes

## Conclusion
This was a good dram but it didn't really standout to me. The Fire and Cane and IPA Cask each tasted very unique whereas this tasted like a pretty generic Speyside scotch. It was sweet and fruity with a little something more to it. The higher proof was a nice treat as most Glenfiddichs are in the 80s but overall I preferred the other two experimental series. That said another solid and affordable scotch from Glenfiddich.

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
