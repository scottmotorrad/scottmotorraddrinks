## Old Kirk 6917

**Age**: 6 years 9 months

**Proof**: 129.7

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is sweet with a big bubble gum note. The palate is classic bourbon with caramel, vanilla, oak and cherry notes. The finish is a little hot with baking spice, cinnamon and ethanol burn which is slightly balanced by some dried fruit and vanilla extract.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Not at the level of a WFE Bourbon but not far off.
