## Stagg Bob's Lake City Liquors Pick

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 133.4

**Notes**: Cherry cola, plenty of spice, a nice oak note that makes it taste a little older, some vanilla on the long spicy finish

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Amazing bottle, I will miss it but not as much as I'll miss Bob's
