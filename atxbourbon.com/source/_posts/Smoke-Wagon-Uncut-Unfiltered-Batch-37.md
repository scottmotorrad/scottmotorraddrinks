## Smoke Wagon Uncut Unfiltered Batch 37


**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 115.2

### Neat

**Notes**: Brown sugar, oak and heat on the nose. The palate is spice forward with rye and baking spice balanced by rich oak and vanilla frosting. The finish is long spicy and slightly dry with baking spice and oak notes.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** One of the spicier batches for me. Quite good.
