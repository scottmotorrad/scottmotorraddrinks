## Knob Creek 12

**Age**: 12 years

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is rich and sweet with nuts, caramel and vanilla cream. The palate leans in on those notes and balances with some rye spice. The finish is long and slightly dry with oak and vanilla. Overall this is a great execution of the classic Beam bourbon profile. It doesnâ€™t bring any new or surprising notes but the depth of the notes and the balance are excellent. The mouthfeel and proof integration are on point for 100 proof.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Not as good as the 18 year but not far off and way easier to get
