## Nickel City Eagle Rare 2020

**Age**: 10 years

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: Sweet cherry and rich oak are the dominant notes throughout. The proof integration is excellent and this goes down very smooth. The mouthfeel is solid for the proof. The finish is long with lingering cherry and baking spice.


**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** A solid Eagle Rare pick from a great bar
