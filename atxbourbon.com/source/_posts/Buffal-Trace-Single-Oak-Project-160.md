## Buffalo Trace Single Oak Project 160

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: Smells and tastes a lot like Eagle Rare. Nose is sweet and earthy with cherry and live oak notes. The palate brings the cherry and oak plus vanilla and a hint of spice. The finish is long and woody. The taste evokes eating a cherry candy in the woods.

**Stars**: **1** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

**TL;DR:** A small upgrade to Eagle Rare but harder to get and more expensive
