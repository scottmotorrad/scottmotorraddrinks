This was one of the early picks I partnered with Debs on and I am finally killing my second bottle so it's time for a quick review.

## Elijah Craig Debs Liquor Single Barrel

**Age**: 10 Years

**Proof**: 94

**Barrel No:** 6030740

**Rickhouse**: G - 4

### Neat

**Notes**: Vanilla extract, slightly dry oak, less nuts than I usually get from Heaven Hill and a nice spice kick at the end. The mouthfeel is a touch thin but what I would expect for the proof. The finish is long and leaves oak and vanilla notes. 

## Conclusion

**TL;DR:** A solid, on profile pick from back when these weren't barrel proof.
