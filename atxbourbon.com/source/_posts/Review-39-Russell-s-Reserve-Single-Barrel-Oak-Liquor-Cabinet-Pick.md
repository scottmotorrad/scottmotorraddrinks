Russell's Reserve is the fancy version of Wild Turkey, long time readers will remember my *super accurate* [mid flight review](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/01/Reviews-8-9-Wild-Turkey-101-and-Jack-Daniel-s-7-on-a-plane/) of the 101. Anyways I haven't explored the high end WT world all that much yet but when [my favorite shop](https://www.instagram.com/oakliquorcabinet/) got in a Single Barrel Select and it was available for delivery before a work happy hour that I'd promised to bring bourbon to I couldn't resist. Potential spoiler but I ended up picking up another bottle for my house too, just to be safe, and I'll be nosing and sipping that one this evening. 

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 110 Proof (55% ABV)

**Mashbill**: 75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley

**Color**: A deep amber

**Price**: $55.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Surprisingly hot at first though big oak and toffee notes cut through the heat

**Taste**: Much tamer than the nose as far as heat goes and the same notes stay very prevalent

**Finish**: Long finish where the oak gives way to a creamy vanilla finish

### On a rock
**Nose**: The heat is gone leaving a balanced set of oak, toffee and vanilla notes

**Taste**: This is where this bourbon really shines for me with an great mouthfeel and bold oak and toffee flavors that have no trouble standing up to the ice. Very tasty.

**Finish**: Still long and still oak fading to vanilla

## Conclusion
Another great store pick from Oak Liquor Cabinet. This one is a little hot for me neat but is delicious on ice. I'd love to try a variation on this that was aged for a few more years or finished somehow to add a another note and tame the heat a bit. So far this is my favorite expression from Wild Turkey but I'll have to try some more of their high end offerings.
