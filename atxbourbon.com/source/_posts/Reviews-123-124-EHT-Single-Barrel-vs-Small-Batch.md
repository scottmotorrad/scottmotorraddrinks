After drinking my way through a number of sub $40 bottled in bond bourbon we'll come to the end of the line with EH Taylor Small Batch and compare it side by side with it's more expensive Single Barrel expression. As far as I know the EHT lineup are Buffalo Trace's only bottled in bond offerings, other than the EHT barrel proof of course. In a world where Blanton's and Eagle Rare are getting harder to find EHT Small Batch is still pretty reliably available at retailish prices here in Austin. But we're not here to muse on the Buffalo Trace line up so let's taste some whiskey and see how they stack up against the rest of the bottled in bond drinker lineup!

## 2017 Colonel EH Taylor Small Batch
**Age**: NAS but 4+ years from Bottled in Bond

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Color**: A medium gold 

**Price**: $39.99

**Laser Code**: L172830112097

**Nose**: Vanilla, caramel, cherry and oak

**Taste**: Oak, vanilla, caramel, cherry, slightly thinner mouthfeel than the SiB but still nice

**Finish**: Short to medium length sweet with cherry, oak and vanilla

## Conclusion
These were both very good and handily beat out the rest of the bottled in bond bourbons in this series. I'm a fan of the Buffalo Trace profile and a higher quality, higher proof release at a good price is hard to argue with. After drinking the EHT Small Batch alongside the Dickel BiB I realized that the Dickel wasn't going to have a long term place on my shelf as long as EHT was easy enough to find.

To compare the two this SiB was a bit better but not by much and definitely not by enough to justify the price increase. Somewhat oddly this SiB did not have nearly as much vanilla as I usually get from EHT. I prefer my current bottle of Blanton's to both of these and they are on par to slightly better than the bottle of Eagle Rare I have right now. I've had some amazing EHT SiB but unfortunately this barrel was just 'good'. Given the price, scarcity and variance on the Single Barrels I don't think they are a good value proposition and I'd recommend grabbing the Small Batch over it to most folks. All that said I'll probably pick another one up at some point chasing those honey barrels.

**TL;DR:** Great whiskey, go with the Small Batch.

### SiB
**7** - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar

**Poor** - Overpriced, not worth the money

### SmB
**7** - a great whiskey I'd order at a bar

**Great** - A great deal, I'd buy it again
