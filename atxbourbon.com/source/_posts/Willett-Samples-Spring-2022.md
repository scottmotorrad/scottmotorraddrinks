## Willett "Will It"

**Age**: 6 years

**Proof**: 117.8

**Barrel Number**: 3264 

### Neat

**Notes**: Caramel spread on high end honey wheat bread balanced by a long spicy finish. Great mouthfeel for the proof. A touch more ethanol burn than I would expect at this proof.

**Stars**: 3 - I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Willett "Cask Pick"

**Age**: 6 years

**Proof**: 127.8

**Barrel Number**: 2869

### Neat

**Notes**: Classic Willett bourbon notes with sticky caramel, mint, warm spice, vanilla and a bit of oak. Brilliantly balanced with a long warm finish, excellent proof integration and a viscous mouthfeel.

**Stars**: 3 - I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Willett "PAC Edge Spring 2022 #1"

**Age**: 8 years

**Proof**: 129.4

**Barrel Number**: 6546

### Neat

**Notes**: Almost like a single malt scotch with honey, pear and dried fruit notes. Some caramel and spice in there as well. Great proof integration and mouthfeel.

**Stars**: 2 - I would want to have a bottle

**TL;DR:** Cask pick and Will It were awesome. The PAC Edge pick was weird but good.
