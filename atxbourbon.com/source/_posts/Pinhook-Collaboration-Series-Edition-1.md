## Pinhook Collaboration Series Edition 1

**Age**: 10 Years

**Proof**: 115.3

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is sharp and earthy with wet wood and acidic notes. The palate brings in some caramel sweetness but tastes heavily of charred wood. The long finish is more charred oak and more caramel but is quite nice if a bit simple. The mouthfeel was very nice and viscous and the proof was well integrated with a bit of heat but not enough to detract.

**Stars**: **0** - **Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

**TL;DR:** A fine whiskey but I expected more. Not something to hunt.
