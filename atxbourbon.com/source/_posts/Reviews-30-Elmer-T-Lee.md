Tejas Liquor had their south Austin grand opening and released some rare stock to commemorate the event and since my wife is on a business trip(if you read this please get some [291 Rye](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/02/Review-23-291-Single-Barrel-Colorado-Rye-Whiskey/)!) it seemed like a good day to hang around at a liquor store. I managed to snag a few things and we'll be kicking off those reviews with Elmer T Lee. This is a single barrel release from Buffalo Trace honoring a former Master Distiller of the same name. In my experience this juice is pretty hyped so let's see if it lives up!

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 90 proof (45% ABV)

**Color**: A medium gold 

**Price**: $39.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Very strong with notes of vanilla and a bitterness almost like hops to it. A little astringent as well.

**Taste**: Very sweet with honey and dark fruit notes. A little thin on the mouth.

**Finish**: A nice combo of spice and vanilla for a surprisingly long finish

### On a rock
**Nose**: Significantly muted by the ice though the vanilla still carries through

**Taste**: The ice improves the mouth feel and largely leaves the notes intact. The honey is the most prominent note on the rocks. 

**Finish**: Shortened a bit but still vanilla and spice

## Conclusion
It's a good whiskey, no doubt about it but maybe it was just a little overhyped for me. As far as Buffalo Trace's single barrel offerings go I think I'll stick with EHT SiB and Blanton's especially given how hard this is to come by. That said if you get the chance to order a pour or pick up a bottle for near retail I'd definitely recommend it. 

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar
