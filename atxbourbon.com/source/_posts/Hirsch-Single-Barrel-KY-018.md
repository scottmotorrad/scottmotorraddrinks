## Hirsch Single Barrel KY-018

**Age**: 7 years 9 months

**Proof**: 137.6

### Neat

**Notes**: Reminiscent of Willett with notes of mint and dark fruit on the nose plus a bit of proof sting. The palate is like an alcoholic Christmas fruit cake with dried fruit, warm spice and vanilla and caramel notes. The mouthfeel is in line with what I would expect for a high proof bourbon but doesn't stand out. The finish is long, warm and slightly dry with dried fruit, baking spice, oak and vanilla notes. The proof integration is very impressive as the only place that stands out as 137.6 proof is the nose. 


**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Conclusion


Between the taste, the mashbill and the age I am highly confident this is Willett distillate and a better batch than the Old Kirk.


**TL;DR:** Tastes like Willett. Very glad I have backups plural
