## Info
Tonight's bourbon is Barrell Bourbon Single Barrel [Oak Liquor Cabinet](https://www.instagram.com/oakliquorcabinet/) Select. I don't know much about the brand but I'm a sucker for single barrels and store selects and I was curious about the 14 year age statement. I couldn't find much about them online either.

**Mashbill**: Unknown

**Abv**: 115.4 proof (57.7% ABV)

**Age**: 14 years (thanks u/bvndwidth)

**Price**: ~$80 USD for a 750ml bottle

## Review

**Color**: A golden amber, very bourbony

### Neat

**Nose**: Sweet, toasted marshmellow with a hint of something floral

**Taste**: More toastd marshmellow but surprisingly short and simple for something aged 14 years with just a touch of heat

**Finish**: Again sweet and disappointly short.

### On a rock

**Nose**: Opens up with floral honey notes, this was the best part

**Taste**: Honey and toasted marshmellow. A slight improvement over neat.

**Finish**: Not much of one. Maybe a touch of sweetness?

## Conclusion

This was perfectly good bourbon but nothing special at all. I was a bit hyped up on this so that probably contributed to my disappointment. I'd always sort of wondered why bourbon generally isn't aged as long as scotch usually is but this bottle suggests that the shorter aging is the way to go. With how medicocre this was, especially given that this is a store select, single barrel and sort of pricy, I don't think I'll be following up on more of their catalog.

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but wouldn't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
