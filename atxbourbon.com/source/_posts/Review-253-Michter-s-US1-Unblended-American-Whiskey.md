Michter's Unblended American Whiskey is an unusual release in the modern American whiskey scene. It's aged in used barrels, carries no age state, is at a low and unusual proof and tells us basically nothing about what's in the bottle. Drinking the whole thing seemed like the best way to gain a deeper understanding so here we are.

## Review #253: Michter's US1 Unblended American Whiskey
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 83.4 proof

**Price**: $45

**Batch No**: 1811337

### Neat
**Nose**: More potent than I expected for the proof with vanilla, caramel and faint spice notes.

**Taste**: Sweet with vanilla frosting, citrus and caramel. Thin mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Short and simple with quickly fading sweetness.

## Conclusion

I will say that "whiskey soaked barrels" is my new favorite way to say "used barrels" and that's also my favorite part of this dram. There was nothing wrong with it but other than the surprisingly nice nose it was dull and underwhelming throughout. If it was a budget priced offering I'd be happy enough with this but at a premium price point it doesn't make any sense to me.

**TL;DR:** Inoffensive but boring low proofer that's priced like something better


**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this
