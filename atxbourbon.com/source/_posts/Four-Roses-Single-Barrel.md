In the precovid times one of the last non work trips I went on was to Charleston South Carolina where I picked up a Four Roses I hadn't seen before: a pick that wasn't barrel strength. I've been meaning to blind it against an off the shelf Four Roses Single Barrel for quite some time and today is the day! I tasted these blind and then sat down to write more detailed tasting notes.

## Four Roses Single Barrel

**Age**: NAS on the bottle (7-9 years according to their website)

**Proof**: 100

**Price**: $43

**Barrel**: 69-1O

### Neat
**Nose**: Dried fruit, rich oak and a strong vanilla note.

**Taste**: Simple but enjoyable with caramel, fruit and warm spice notes. Pleasant but unremarkable mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with fading dried fruit and lingering oak, spice and vanilla notes.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Four Roses Single Barrel South Carolina

**Age**: 7 years 4 months

**Proof**: 100

**Price**: $40-50 range

**Barrel**: 19-6R

### Neat
**Nose**: More spice and more oak than the non-pick with the same dried fruit but less vanilla.

**Taste**: Fruitcake with dried fruit and holiday spice alongside a nice oak note. Couldn't really tell a difference in mouthfeel from the non pick.

**Finish**: Shorter, cleaner finish than the non pick with fading fruit and vanilla and bit of spice.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion

I think Four Roses Single Barrel is an good whiskey and better than most shelf offerings at that price point but it's not something I am regularly going to pick up a bottle of anymore, especially with the Small Batch Select being readily available here and my deep bench of their barrel strength picks. The South Carolina pick was a little better but not enough to bump it up, especially since the finish was a step back. I'd probably grab a different Single Barrel pick if I came across one but wouldn't go out of my way to find one and don't feel like I needed a back up here.

**TL;DR:** The pick was slightly better, both great shelf bottles but not worth hunting/hoarding
