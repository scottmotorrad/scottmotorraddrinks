## Info
My wife wanted to fly Southwest so I'm limited to their excellent whiskey selection this evening but it seemed like as good a time an any to review some Wild Turkey 101 and some Jack Daniel's #7. Typing this up on mobile so forgive any typos. Also the photo is the Turkey; you guys can imagine what Jack looks like in a plastic cup.

## Wild Turkey 

**Mashbill**: Unknown but high rye

**Abv**: 101 proof (50.5% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

**Price**: ~$7 USD for a 50ml bottle

## Review

**Color**: A darker amber

### Neat

**Nose**: Somewhat alcohol forward with sweet and spicy notes

**Taste**: Hot and a little harsh though the baking spice comes through after the initial taste

**Finish**: Surprisingly nice medium finish that is spicy and just a little sweet

### On a rock

**Nose**: More muted but still alcohol forward. The spice remains but any sweetness was muted.

**Taste**: Much less heat with baking spice and a touch of honey. Surprisingly nice.

**Finish**: The finish holds up well with the ice with a balance of sweet and spice


## Jack Daniel's

**Mashbill**: Unknown

**Abv**: 80 proof (40% ABV)

**Age**: NAS

**Price**: ~$7 USD for a 50ml bottle

## Review

**Color**: A medium golden color

### Neat

**Nose**: Sweet smooth and a little fruity, easily the best part

**Taste**: Bananas with nuts, almost like a somewhat disappointing bananas foster. I'm disappointed there is alcohol heat in something 80 proof

**Finish**: Medium finish with banana notes and then something a little funky at the end

### On a rock

**Nose**: Muted but light alcohol and fruit notes

**Taste**: The banana and nuttiness are still there but less so and any alcohol heat is gone. Somewhat dull and bland.

**Finish**: Just that little bit of funk

### With Coke Zero

**Nose**:  Sweet notes of cola

**Taste**: Tastes heavily of cola but with the banana note sneaking through

**Finish**: Blessedly gone, just a bit of that cola tatse

## Conclusion

I'll start by saying the Turkey was definitely better than flying without whiskey but it won't be a regular choice for me. I'd definitely be happy to use it as a mixer or drink it on the rocks in a pinch.


As for the Jack it was not good though I did enjoy it with a Coke Zero. It still baffles me how this became one of the most popular whiskies in America. On a completely random note my brother has picked up a bit of taste in whiskey from me and is trying to convert his Air Force squadron away from Jack to something better in a similar price range. I've already suggested Evan Williams and Old Grandad but let me know if you have any better ideas.


### Wild Turkey
**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

### Jack Daniel's
**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but wouldn't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
