When Bourbon Enthusiast announced he was releasing his own brand I was excited to try it and grabbed the first batch. It's almost gone so it's time for a review.

## Union Trail 5 Year

**Age**: 5 years

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is simple and sweet vanilla, grain and brown sugar notes. The palate brings more of the same with some cherry and spice as well. The finish is medium length with fading sweetness and lingering spice. The mouthfeel and proof integration were competent and what I would expect at 100 proof.

**Stars**: **0** - **Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this  over other readily available options

## Conclusion


Overall this is a solid bourbon but the midrange high rye bourbon space is very crowded and this bottle doesnâ€™t stand out from the crowd. I've enjoyed it neat, on the rocks and in cocktails and don't regret snagging it but I am not going to be tracking down another one.


**TL;DR:** Solid but nothing to hunt down
