A local store got in a shipment of T.W. Samuel's Straight Bourbon Whiskey which is usually not available here in Texas. When I was trying to buy something else they told me I should really get this, it was super good, very cheap, etc. I was skeptical but since it was only $10.99 for a liter I went ahead and bought it. Let's see if it's any good.

## Review #251: T.W. Samuels Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
**Age**: 3 years

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Price**: $11 for 1 liter

### Neat
**Nose**: Corn, nuts and caramel

**Taste**: Lots of grain, slightly harsh, some nicer caramel towards the end. Very thin mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Short with corn and caramel.

### With Cherry Coke Zero
**Nose**: Dark fruit, cola, faint corn, hints of caramel and nuts

**Taste**: The grain cuts right through the cherry and cola notes.

**Finish**: Short with primarily cola notes.


## Conclusion
I'm not a fan of this one. Thankfully it didn't have any offensive notes but it was very grainy and didn't really have much going for it. Honestly it wasn't a good mixer either. If I absolutely only had $11 for bourbon I would buy a 750ml of Evan Williams or Ancient Age over this everyday or if I really needed a cheap liter of bourbon it is only $4 more for for Evan Williams, here in Texas at least.

**TL;DR:** Thin, grainy and boring. Well that was disappointing.
