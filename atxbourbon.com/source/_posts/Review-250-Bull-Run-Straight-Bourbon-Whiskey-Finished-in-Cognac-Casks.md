For part 21 of my finished whisky series I'm taking a look at Bull Run. Bull Run is a distillery in Portland Oregon who finishes MGP bourbons and light whiskies among other things. They recently released a straight bourbon whiskey finished in cognac casks which sounded like something I would like. Thankfully  A friend of mine from back in Seattle introduced them to me back when I used to travel up there for work and was able to get me a bottle of this release.

[I also tasted this blind](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CC84F-cHy-O/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) against Joseph Magnus [Cigar Blend Batch 19](https://atxbourbon.com/2020/07/18/Review-249-Joseph-Magnus-Cigar-Blend-Batch-19/) and Bardstown Bourbon Company [Chateau De Labade](https://atxbourbon.com/2020/06/13/Reviews-237-Bardstown-Bourbon-Company-Chateau-De-Laubade/).

## Review #250 Bull Run Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished in Cognac Casks
**Age**: 12 years

**Finish**: 1 year in Hennessy Cognac casks

**Abv**: 124.64 proof

**Price**: $125

### Neat
**Nose**: Dark fruit, vanilla, warm spice and fainter herbal notes.

**Taste**: A little hot with cinnamon, dark fruit, leather, grapes, and something sticky sweet towards the end. Viscous mouthfeel as I would expect at that proof.

**Finish**:  Long, warm and dry with lingering dried fruit, cinnamon and oak.

## Conclusion

That was good, if a bit too hot/spicy for my tastes but there were a lot of great flavors too. This one isn't going to be a daily drinker for me but I'm glad to have this bottle. It's definitely one of the more distinct finished bourbons I have.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** A little too hot and cinnamon for my taste but otherwise great. I think I'll like it better in the fall/winter
