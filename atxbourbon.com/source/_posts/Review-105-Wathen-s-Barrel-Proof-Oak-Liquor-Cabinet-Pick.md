I'd never heard of Wathen's before my local shop got a barrel pick in. I was curious and looked into them a bit but pretty all we know about this bottle is what's on the label. It's Kentucky Straight Bourbon and it's sourced from somewhere. The owner/picker described this one as 'liquid candy' so let's see if it live up to that tag line.

## Wathen's Barrel Proof Oak Liquor Cabinet Pick
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 124.7 proof

**Color**: A medium amber gold 

**Price**: $80

**Barrel Number**: 75 out of 75

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and spicy with predominately cinnamon sugar notes and a touch of vanilla.

**Taste**: Very similar to the nose it's all cinnamon sugar with a solid mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Very dry medium length finish with mostly cinnamon notes.

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice took the edge off off the cinnamon quite nicely and brought out more of the vanilla.

**Taste**: Very similar to the neat taste but again with less cinnamon and a bit of vanilla and caramel brought in.

**Finish**: Less dry but still very cinnamon forward and medium length.

## Conclusion
Red Hots are a candy and this reminded me a lot of a liquid version of those so I'd definitely say it lived up to the tag line. It was very easy to drink especially given the proof. Unfortunately cinnamon isn't my favorite note so this wasn't the best fit for me especially given the price. That said if you like cinnamon candy and deceptively high proof bourbon this might be the bottle for you.

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks
