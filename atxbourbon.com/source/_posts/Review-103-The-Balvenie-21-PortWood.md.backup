This is the third and final 21 year old Speyside single malt in this series. We started with the [Glenfarclas 21](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/24/Review-96-Glenfarclas-21/) followed up with the [Glenfiddich 21](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/30/Review-99-Glenfiddich-21/) and are finishing it off with the Balvenie 21 Portwood. Let's see how this stacks up against the Glenfarclas and the Glenfiddich.

## Balvenie 21 Portwood
**Age**: 21 years

**Abv**: 86 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $199.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich, sweet dark cherry and sherry notes dominate the nose. 

**Taste**: Honey, dark cherry, cream and warm spice notes compliment a nice and viscous mouthfeel, especially for the proof.

**Finish**: Long and sweet with honey, hints of dark fruit and gentle spice notes.

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


## Conclusion
This was easily my favorite of the 3 and the only one I'd semi-regularly pick over it's 17/18 year brethren which made me realize that I haven't written about the younger Balvenie selections yet so I'll have get on that. The Port influence was clear throughout and I'm a big fan of Ported whiskies so it was no surprise I loved this. It was primarily sweet and fruity with just enough spice to give it depth. 

Apparently there is a duty free exclusive version of this that is NCF and 95.2 proof so I'll be keeping an eye out for that on my next international trip!
