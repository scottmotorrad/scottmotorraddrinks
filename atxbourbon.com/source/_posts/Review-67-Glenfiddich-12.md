{% asset_img image.jpg "Glenfiddich 12"%}

I'm in Seattle for work this week and the liquor prices are crazy here so it seemed like a good time to grab some mini bottles of Glenfiddich's entry level single malt. I've had this dram many times over the years and tend to enjoy it more as a mixer but let's see how it stacks up today!

## Review
**Age**: 12 years

**Abv**: 80 proof 

**Color**: A medium gold

**Price**: $38.99(for a 750ml back home)

### Neat
**Nose**: Light and sweet with primarily pear and malt notes and hints of citrus and oak

**Taste**: Medium bodied with malt and oak alongside light citrus notes. The mouthfeel is a little thin but that's expected with the low ABV

**Finish**: Short and simple finish

### On a rock
**Nose**: Mostly malt with fainter pair and oak notes

**Taste**: The ice improves the mouthfeel but brings out a slightly bitter note alongside the oak and malt

**Finish**: Slightly shorter than it was neat

## Conclusion
This is the entry level Glenfiddich and it shows in the lack of complexity especially compared to the excellent 15 year. That said the  notes that are there are pleasant and there's nothing wrong with it. While I'm not the biggest fan of this neat or on ice I do enjoy it in Highball or Penicillin. If you want a single malt for mixing and that you can also drink neat at a reasonable price this a solid choice.

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

You can also follow me on [Instagram(@atxbourbon)](https://www.instagram.com/atxbourbon/) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottmotorraddrinks/) to keep up with these reviews and my other whiskey-centric adventures.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
