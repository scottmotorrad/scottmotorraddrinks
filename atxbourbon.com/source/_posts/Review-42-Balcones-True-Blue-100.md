Balcones is a craft distiller in Waco Texas(Sic Em Bears!) that actually distills their own juice and makes some great, if young, products. In a world of NDPs marketing as local products it's great to get to try some actual local juice.

## Review
**Age**: 2 years 4 months

**Abv**: 100 proof

**Mashbill**: 100% Blue Corn

**Color**: A deep reddish amber

**Price**: $51.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet, cinnamon and juicy citrus notes comes together almost like one of those orange cinnamon rolls with a touch of burn

**Taste**: More citrus and cinnamon notes and the sweetness from the nose becomes more of a caramel 

**Finish**: Medium length with big cinnamon notes though it is a little hot for me 

### On a rock
**Nose**: Softer and sweet with caramel and citrus notes

**Taste**: Very similar to the neat taste with an improved mouthfeel all citrus, cinnamon and caramel

**Finish**: Slightly tamed from the neat finish with some more sweetness to balance the hot cinnamon 

## Conclusion
Is it a little young and a little hot? Sure. Is it a bit expensive for what is? Probably. Is it a great craft whiskey from a local distiller. Definitely. I'm a big fan of Balcones in general and can't wait to try some of their newer releases and some more aged releases as they continue to mature.
