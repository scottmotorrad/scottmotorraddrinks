When I first saw this was coming I knew I had to get a bottle. A blend of 6 year Willett bourbon and 10 year MGP rye sounded interesting no matter what and I've always been a fan of High West's bourye so I felt like this would be right up my alley.

## Willett Blend of Straight Whiskies

**Age**: A blend of 6 and 10 year

**Proof**: 104

### Neat

**Notes**: Very well balanced between sweet, herbal and spicy with dark fruit, herbal liqueur and rye spice notes. Long, warm and sweet finish with more fruit and spice.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Conclusion

Overall I am a big fan and glad I grabbed a backup. I'd love to see them do a take on this with all their own distillate. As far as comparable offerings go I definitely put this above High West Bourye and I can't wait to see how it stacks up against this year's Wild Turkey Master's Keep. 


**TL;DR:** My favorite bourbon rye blend so far.
