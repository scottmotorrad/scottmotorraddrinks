I had the chance to help pick some Heavenâ€™s Door barrels for Specâ€™s earlier this year with @jordavis_ and @longhornbourbon ðŸ¥ƒ We selected 4 barrels and my favorite of the bunch was a 7 year old sourced from MGP weighing in at 116.4 proof. Itâ€™s a classic MGP flavor profile with a sweet, fruity nose, brown sugar on the palate and a long warm finish. Itâ€™s dangerously easy to drink for the proof and this bottle has gone very fast. Heavenâ€™s Door is continuing to improve their offerings and Iâ€™m looking forward to the barrels they bring to Texas next!
