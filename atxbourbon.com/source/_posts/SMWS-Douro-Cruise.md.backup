When Scotch Malt Whisky Society started doing blends I wasn’t sure that was for me but then they announced their 14th batch, Douro Cruise, and since I am a sucker for port aged whisky I had to give it a shot. I’m very glad I did.

## SMWS Douro Cruise

**Age**: 10 years

**Proof**: 100

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is sweet and rich with honey, pear and strawberry notes. The palate brings more honey, some malt and dried dark fruit notes. The finish is long with plenty of sweet fruit balanced by warm spice and a subtle oak. The proof integration and mouthfeel are solid and what I would expect from a 100 proof single malt.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whisky:** I would want to have a bottle


## Conclusion

Overall this was a great whiskey that was sweet and relatively straightforward but really nailed the notes it brought. This bottle definitely opened me up to future blends from SMWS.

**TL;DR:** Great bottle, sweet and easy. Looking forward to more SMWS blends.
