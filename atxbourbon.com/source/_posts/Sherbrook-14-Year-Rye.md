When Seelbach’s started releasing the Maryland Heritage Series I wasn’t really sure what to think and didn’t catch the first release of these ryes. After grabbing the 16 year old bourbon they released I wished I had grabbed the ryes too. Thankfully they did another release of the Sherbrook.

## Sherbrook Rye

**Age**: 14 years

**Proof**: 109.7

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is rich and creamy with creme brulee and herbal notes. That palate is perfectly balanced with more of the creamy vanilla from the nose, more herbs and a good amount of rye spice and rich oak. The finish is long, sweet and spicy with brown sugar and cinnamon notes.


**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle
 

## Conclusion

This is an amazing rye. I am looking forward to a blind with some of my favorite old ryes: High West Rocky Mountain Rye and Kentucky Owl Batch 4. 

**TL;DR:** Excellent, well aged MGP rye. This one is going to be hard to beat.
