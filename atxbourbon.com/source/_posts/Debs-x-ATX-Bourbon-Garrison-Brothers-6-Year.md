## Debs x ATX Bourbon Garrison Brothers 6 Year

**Age**: 6 years

**Proof**: 124.8

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is rich with sweet corn and caramel notes. The palate brings the classic Garrison house flavor of sweet corn and charred oak plus plenty of caramel. The finish is long and sweet with lingering oak and caramel.

## Conclusion

Obviously I liked this one :) It takes the classic barrel proof Garrison profile and adds a bunch of caramel to it.
