Michter’s 10 releases are always on my must buy list of the year. I’m finally finishing the 2021 rye so it’s time for a review.


I could have done with a longer finish but overall this is another strong release from Michter’s. I still hope there comes a day when we don’t have to pick between the 10 year age statement and being barrel strength for Michter’s releases.

## 2021 Michter's 10 Year Rye

**Age**: 10 years

**Proof**: 92.8

**Barrel No**: 21G1970 

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is surprisingly rich for the proof with plenty of oak and spice. The palate is brilliantly balanced with oak, rye and baking spice, sweet herbs and vanilla cream. The mouthfeel is quite nice, especially for the proof. The medium length finish has notes of vanilla and baking spice.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


## Conclusion

I could have done with a longer finish but overall this is another strong release from Michter’s. This year wasn't a standout in either direction for me but I was more than happy with the bottle. I still hope there comes a day when we don’t have to pick between the 10 year age statement and being barrel strength for Michter’s releases.

**TL;DR:** Low proof, lots of flavor. Just what you would expect from M10R.
