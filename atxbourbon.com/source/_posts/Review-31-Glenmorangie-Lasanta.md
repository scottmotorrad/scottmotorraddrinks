After a long string of bourbon reviews it felt like it was time to branch out into scotch as well. Speyside scotches are what kicked off my whiskey journey initially and my bottle of Lasanta was getting low so it seemed like a great place to start reviewing scotch.

## Review
**Age**: 12

**Abv**: 86 proof (43% ABV)

**Color**: A light to medium gold 

**Price**: $42.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet, almost cloying, notes that are very sherry forward with oak and a bit spice 

**Taste**: Has an interesting overipe fruit note as well a strong sherry note, oak and more warm spice. The mouth feel is surprisingly nice given the proof

**Finish**: Medium length finish with some caramel notes coming in. Finishes a bit more like a bourbon.

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice helps tame the sweetness to a more accessible level while retaining the sherry and oak notes

**Taste**:  Also improved by the ice as the warm spice note is strengthened and the caramel note from the neat finish is present as well. The pleasant mouth feel remains

**Finish**: The spice and fruit note are more present in this warm, medium long finish

## Conclusion 
Overall this one has some ups and downs for me. It's a bit too aggressively sweet especially when neat but there are some more interesting notes in there as well. Overall a solid whiskey but there are definitely similarly priced whiskies I prefer, such as Glenfarclas 12, and going vertical the Quinta Ruban is a big step up and I'd pretty much always suggest spending the extra few bucks.

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
