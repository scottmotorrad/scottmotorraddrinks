I am trying to clear out some older, lower fill level bottles to make room for release season so these 2020 releases of Elijah Craig 18 Year and Toasted Barrel need to go! Which means it is time for a review.

## Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 94 proof

### Neat
**Nose**: Vanilla and oak with a bbq smokiness

**Taste**: Vanilla extract, oak tannins, tobacco, rye spice, fainter sweet caramel toward the end. Surprisingly good mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with slightly dry oak and vanilla 

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Elijah Craig 18 Year 2020
**Age**: 18 years

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Bottled**: 1-10-20

**Barrel**: 4909

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and rich with oak, caramel and vanilla extract plus some subtle nutty notes.

**Taste**: Leather, oak, vanilla cream, caramel nuts and warm spices. Good mouthfeel for the proof but still 90 proof.

**Finish**: Long finish with lingering oak and warm spice.

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

## Conclusion

Overall I enjoyed both bottles, especially the EC18. The Toasted had a really nice smoky note on the nose and pleasant sweet and oak notes throughout. It's definitely a step up from regular Elijah Craig and I think it's a good buy at retail though I'd probably reach for a good store pick over it. This barrel of EC18 had a great leather note that I really enjoyed as well as the classic Elijach Craig notes. 90 proof is a little bit of a bummer here but sometimes you want a low proof, high flavor option and this bottle fits the bill!

I missed out on the 2021 releases so I did sort of nurse these. I won't be in rush to grab another toasted barrel since there are a plethora of toasted options on the market but I'll be keeping my eye out for the 2022 release of Elijah Craig 18 for sure.

**TL;DR:** Both are good bottles, I wish they were higher proof
