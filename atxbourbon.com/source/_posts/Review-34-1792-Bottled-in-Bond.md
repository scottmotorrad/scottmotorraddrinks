The 1792 review series continues! The Bottled in Bond is a bit harder to find than the Single Barrel, Full Proof and Small Batch but not as harder as some of the others. Bottled in Bond refers to the [Bottled in Bond Act of 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_in_bond), when the US government was focused on real problems like crappy bourbon. As weird as it is to have a law about this bottled in bond whiskey tends to be pretty good so let's dive in.

## Review
**Age**: NAS but at least 4 for BiB

**Abv**: 100 proof (50% ABV)

**Color**: A deeper gold

**Price**: $34.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich caramel and oak notes with just a hint of heat

**Taste**: Very delicious oak forward notes, supporting caramel and a bit of spice

**Finish**: Medium length finish that sweet and oaky

### On a rock
**Nose**: Both the caramel and notes come back from the neat nose but the oak is more muted

**Taste**: The oak is back complimenting the caramel and the spice is more like pepper or something like that.

**Finish**: Shortened by the ice and mostly a more generic caramel finish though towards the end I was getting a little something else in there too

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion
I am big fan of when whiskey has a nice balance of sweet, oak and spice so I really enjoyed this one. I definitely preferred the [1792 Full Proof](http://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/) on ice but this was better neat. I guess I need to keep both bottles on hand now, poor me :) Long time readers may have noticed I'm a bit of a 1792 fan so this wasn't really a surprise. I'm still on the hunt for more 1792 expressions.
