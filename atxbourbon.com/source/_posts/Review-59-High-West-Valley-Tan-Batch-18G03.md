Valley Tan is a Utah whiskey that is actually made from 100% High West distillate. It is a blend of wheat and oak whiskey aged in a combination of new and used oak barrels. This one is bottle number 1941 from batch 18G03. This juice is supposed to be a throwback to the whiskey that the Mormons made in Utah back in the 1800s so let's see if it stands the test of time.

## Review
**Age**: 1 year

**Abv**: 87 proof

**Color**: A light, pale gold

**Price**: $50

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet honey and bright fruity notes with some unexpected harshness

**Taste**: Green apples and honey

**Finish**: Short, slightly sweet finish with just a bit of burn and a bit of oat

### On a rock
**Nose**: Light fruity notes

**Taste**: Thin mouthfeel but nice honey, green apple and melon notes.

**Finish**: Even shorter than the neat though thankfully the burn is gone, the bit of oat remains though

## Conclusion
Oddly this one reminds me more of a mid to low end blended scotch than an American whiskey. I don't get much of what I expected from the wheat and oat whiskies this is blended from. I tried my best to pick notes out but it's relatively smooth and a bit generic tasting. Overall it was better than not drinking whiskey but especially given the price I'd pass on this one.

[**5**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/5/) - a whiskey with notable strengths but also held back by some flaws

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
