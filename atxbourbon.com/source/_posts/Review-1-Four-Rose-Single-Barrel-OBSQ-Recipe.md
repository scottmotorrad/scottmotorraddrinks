**Abv**: 110 proof (55% ABV)

**Age**: 9 years 10 month


## Review

### Neat

**Nose**: Floral and sweet with a bit of cherry and a hint of oak

**Taste**: A little harsh for me but still sweet with cherries, oak, baking spice and vanilla. A little floral but not as much as the nose.

**Finish**: Long finish with lingering cherry and spice. Probably my favorite part of this whiskey

### On a rock

**Nose**: The ice definitely cuts the nose though the floral aroma survives it

**Taste**: Rich, smooth and sweet. Removes any harshness present when it was neat but otherwise tastes very similar if not a little sweeter.

**Finish**: Just as good as neat

## Conclusion 

A sweet bourbon for sure but I have a bit of sweet tooth when it comes to drinking. It's super hot here in Texas so definitely preferred it on the rocks. This was the whiskey that inspired me to start reviewing on Reddit
