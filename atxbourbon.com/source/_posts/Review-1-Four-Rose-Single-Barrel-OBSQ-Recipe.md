## Review

### Neat

**Nose**: Floral and sweet with a bit of cherry and a hint of oak

**Taste**: A little harsh for me but still sweet with cherries, oak, baking spice and vanilla. A little floral but not as much as the nose.

**Finish**: Long finish with lingering cherry and spice. Probably my favorite part of this whiskey

### On a rock

**Nose**: The ice definitely cuts the nose though the floral aroma survives it

**Taste**: Rich, smooth and sweet. Removes any harshness present when it was neat but otherwise tastes very similar if not a little sweeter.

**Finish**: Just as good as neat

## Conclusion 

A sweet bourbon for sure but I have a bit of sweet tooth when it comes to drinking. It's super hot here in Texas so definitely preferred it on the rocks. This was the whiskey that inspired me to start reviewing on Reddit

9/10 - One of my favorites and always on my whiskey shelf

## Scale

My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
