## Vega 33

**Age**: 33 years

**Proof**: 92.4 (cask strength)

**Notes**: Sweet and rich up front with pear, dried fruit and sweet vanilla. Spice and oak come in towards the end and especially on the finish. It makes you want to take the next sip. The mouthfeel is excellent, especially given the proof.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

Everything I want scotch to be (well aged, NCF, cask strength). This is the best North Star release Iâ€™ve had so far!
