And now back to the regularly schedule High West series. Every winter since High West releases A Mid Winter Night's Dram which is a blend of port cask finished rye whiskies. This year's is, I believe, the first year to contain actual High West distillate in addition to MGP and Barton's juice. With that let's get o the penultimate review for the series.

## Review
**Age**: NAS for the aging or finish this year

**Abv**: 98.6 proof

**Color**: A nice deep reddish amber

**Price**: $99.99

### Neat
**Nose**: The nose was just slightly but with rich herbal and sweet dark cherry notes

**Taste**: Herbal notes takes the lead but with more subtly and complexity than the usual dill forward MGP rye notes with a nice balance of sweet dark fruit and warm baking spice notes with an excellent mouthfeel

**Finish**: Long and lingering finish that starts with sweet dark cherries and becomes spicier as it goes

### On a rock
**Nose**: Warm spice and sweet dark cherry notes

**Taste**: Less spicy but still with herbal and sweet cherry notes and a nice mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium length sweet finish with more cherry notes.

## Conclusion
This year's MWND was excellent; a step up from [last year's](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/19/Review-16-A-Mid-Winter-Night-s-Dram-Act-5-Scene-3-Mystery-Sample/) which had a little more dill than I prefer. The balance between the sweet, spicy and herbal notes was excellent and I preferred it neat. That extra bit of proof over most High West offerings also helps the flavors and mouthfeel. I get a bottle or two every year and am very glad I snagged 2 for this year :) All that said it wasn't as good as the [Barrel Select Rendezvous Rye finished in Port Casks for 4 year and 7 months](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/31/Review-58-High-West-Rendezvous-Rye-Barrel-Select-Port-Finish-2018/).

[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'll buy from time to time

[**Fair**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/fair-value/) - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
