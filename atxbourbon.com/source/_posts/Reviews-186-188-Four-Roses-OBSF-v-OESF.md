This is the fourth yeast strain tasting in my Four Roses series with a blind tasting of the F yeast strain. I have 3 picks ranging from 9 to 10 years and from 110 to 117 proof. None of the bottle are from Texas this time with a bottle from Beastmasters Club, the 2018 Kentucky Derby Festival and K&L Wines.

There's another [blind tasting video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B6bEcHynjDT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) to pick my favorite and then I topped off the glasses and sat down to write these more detailed notes.

## Conclusion
I shouldn't have been surprised when the Beastmasters won since it already [won my blind B recipe tasting](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5oF8HPHoZ-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). The F yeast strain was the one I had the least tasting experience with and it was solid with the Beastmasters pick really standing out. The nose was just ok on that one but everything else was outstanding. The K&L pick was exactly what I would expect from a good Four Roses Private Select but didn't stand out from a lot of the other picks in this series. The Derby bottle wasn't quite at that level but was still very tasty.

Next up is the elusive O yeast strain next week. It's supposed to be fruity which is great for my palate.

**TL;DR:** F is a solid strain and the Beastmasters pick was awesome.
