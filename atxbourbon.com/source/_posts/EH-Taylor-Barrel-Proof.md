I managed to snag a bottle of this year's EH Taylor Barrel Proof a few weeks ago and even got to blind it in a flight with the previous two releases. Needless to say it's a great bottle.

## EH Taylor Barrel Proof Batch 10 (2021)

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 127.3

### Neat

**Nose**: Brandied cherries, rich oak, warm spice and a bit of heat.

**Taste**: Caramel, dark cherry, a little heat, vanilla extract, baking spice and cinnamon. Excellent, viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Long slightly dry, somewhat hot finish with fading cherry syrup then oak and cinnamon.

## Conclusion

First off it's excellent. It is a touch hot on the finish and is very on profile for high proof Buffalo Trace but those are pretty nitpicky criticisms. I did previously blind this against the last two EHT BP releases and it was clearly above last year though we had it a shade behind the 2019 (batch 8).

This is right there with Russell's Reserve 13 Year for my favorite release of the year so far. I'm not sure it cracks the very top echelon of my favorite whiskies but it's close.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


**TL;DR:** Another winner in the EHT lineup, a step up from batch 9
