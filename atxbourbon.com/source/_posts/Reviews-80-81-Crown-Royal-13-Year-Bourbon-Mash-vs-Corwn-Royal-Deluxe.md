So I'm [slowly making my way](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/whiskey-advocate-top-20-2018/) through the [Whiskey Advocate Top 20 Whiskies of 2018](http://whiskyadvocate.com/top20/2018/) this year and reviewing them as I go and just got to my first Canadian whiskey on the list which will also be my first Canadian whiskey review unless you count [Whistle Pig 10 Year](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/11/03/Review-38-Whistle-Pig-Rye-10-Year/) as Canadian. I figured I needed something to baseline the fancy Crown with so I grabbed a mini bottle of their 'Deluxe' to sample alongside it.

## Crown Royal 13 year Bourbon Mash
**Age**: 13 years

**Abv**: 90 proof

**Color**: A deep gold 

**Price**: $64.99

**Mash Bill**: 60% corn, 36% rye, 4% malted barley

### Neat
**Nose**: Very bourbon style nose with oak, vanilla and floral honey notes.

**Taste**: Bright, floral note forward with some vanilla, oak and herbal notes in the background. Unfortunately he mouthfeel was a bit thin for me though that's not unexpected with 90 proof.

**Finish**: Very long, which was a nice treat, with floral, herbal and honey notes.

### On a rock
**Nose**: Improved by the ice with a nice balance of vanilla, honey and oak with hints of floral notes.

**Taste**: The ice improves the mouthfeel significantly and really brings out the herbal notes while subduing the oak.

**Finish**: Much shorter, unfortunately, with predominantly herbal and honey notes.

## Crown Royal Deluxe
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: a pale, light gold 

**Price**: $2.99 for the 50ml bottle

### Neat
**Nose**: Acetone, green apples and maybe a bit of vanilla

**Taste**: Not good, more acetone and sweet vanilla with a very thin mouthfeel

**Finish**: Longer than I would have liked for the flavor profile, just more of the notes from the taste.

### On a rock
**Nose**: Very subdued, hard to pick out clear notes.

**Taste**: Also very subdued but 'smooth' with some vanilla notes coming through. Still a thin mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Short and simple with a dash of vanilla.

### With Coke Zero on a rock
**Nose**: Strong cola notes, with some vanilla and a hint of oak.

**Taste**: Surprisingly nice with a balance of cola and vanilla and a touch of oak much like the nose.

**Finish**: The Crown notes don't really carry into the finish leaving this a mostly just cola.

## Conclusion
As I nosed and tasted the Crown bourbon mash I was a bit disappointed, especially given the cost, but then that finish kicked in and saved the day for me. I wouldn't want to drink this all the time but it would be great for evenings where I just want to sip on one dram for a long time. The floral and herbal notes reminded me a bit of some MGP ryes. It was also quite good on a rock so it would be a good pick for drinking outside during a cookout for example. 

The Crown Deluxe was pretty bad neat, tolerable on ice but quite good as a mixer. I could see myself ordering this over Evan Williams for a whiskey and Coke from time to time as a change up.

While the 13 year bourbon mash was quite good overall I still think rye is the way to go for Canadian whiskey. 

### Crown Royal 13 year Bourbon Mash
