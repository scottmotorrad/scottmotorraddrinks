Gulf Coast Distillers opened up down in Houston a few years ago and more recently released 3 batches of 15 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey with the mystery 78.5/12/8.5 mashbill that so many 15 years have been lately. I believe the first batch was either distillery or Houston only but batches 2 and 3 hit Austin so naturally I grabbed a few bottles.

## The Prideful Goat 15 Year Batch 2

**Age**: 15 years

**Proof**: 113.8

### Neat

**Nose**: Sweet and rich with peanut brittle, oak and faint baking spices.

**Taste**: Oak forward with some tannins balanced by sweet caramel with some spice for depth.  Pleasant mouthfeel that's inline with what I expect for the proof

**Finish**: Long, slightly dry, oaky finish with a bit of heat as well.

**2 Stars** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle

## The Prideful Goat 15 Year Batch 3

**Age**: 15 years

**Proof**: 114.1

### Neat

**Nose**: Darker than Batch 2 with leather, rich oak, caramel and a hint of roasted nuts.

**Taste**: More leather and oak from the nose, the sweetness is more of a vanilla cream than caramel, plenty of warm spices and only hints of nut. Great, viscous mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Medium to long finish with fading vanilla and leather then lingering oak and spice.

**3 Stars** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

## Conclusion

These two batches definitely hit different ends of the old Beam spectrum. Batch 2 is all wood and nuts while Batch 3 is more leather and spice. When I tried them individually I thought it would be really close but side by side the B3 was my winner. No losers here though! Both batches were very tasty and I am looking forward to the rye they are releasing soon.

**TL;DR:** Both goats are great older bourbons but Batch 3 was my winner.
