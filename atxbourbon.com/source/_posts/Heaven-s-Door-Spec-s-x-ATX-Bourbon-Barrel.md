I had the chance to help pick some Heaven’s Door barrels for Spec’s earlier this year with @jordavis_ and @longhornbourbon 🥃 We selected 4 barrels and my favorite of the bunch was a 7 year old sourced from MGP weighing in at 116.4 proof. It’s a classic MGP flavor profile with a sweet, fruity nose, brown sugar on the palate and a long warm finish. It’s dangerously easy to drink for the proof and this bottle has gone very fast. Heaven’s Door is continuing to improve their offerings and I’m looking forward to the barrels they bring to Texas next!
