For part 6 of the finished whiskey we'll be tasting a second Cognac finished rye. Sagamore Spirits is a distillery out of Maryland who is sourcing MGP while their own stocks come to age. Each year they release a finished variation and the 2019 release was a Cognac Finish. I first tried it at Whiskies of the World in Austin and went and grabbed a bottle the next week.

I also have a [blind tasting video for this vs a High West  Barrel Select vs a homemade cognac and rye blend.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9U_d0Gn4vf/)

## Sagamore Spirit Cognac Finish
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 101 proof

**Price**: $62

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and herbaceous with faint rye spice and hints of oak.

**Taste**: Very similar to the nose with MGP herbal notes and a nice fruity sweetness. Solid mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with rye spice, herbal notes and oak 

## Conclusion

The Cognac comes through much stronger on this bottle than the [High West Barrel Select](https://atxbourbon.com/2020/03/04/Review-213-High-West-Rendezvous-Rye-Barrel-Select-Cognac-Finish/) we looked at last time. That I said I preferred the High West but it was close. With how much more available this bottle is it's an easy recommendation for folks wanting to try a good Cognac finished rye. Needless to say the home blend of cognac and rye whiskey was not as good as the actual finished ones.

**TL;DR:** More cognac than the HW, almost as good


[**8**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/8/) - an excellent bottle I'd like to have at home

[**Fair**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/fair-value/) - Worth the money, happy with my purchase
