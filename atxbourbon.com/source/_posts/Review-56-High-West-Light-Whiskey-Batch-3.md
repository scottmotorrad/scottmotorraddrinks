{% asset_img image.jpg "High West Light Whiskey"%}

I'm visiting Utah this week so obviously I'm going to High West's various locations. Today I went by the bar in Park City and tried their 14 year light whiskey. It was super unique so I was happy to pickup a bottle at the gift shop. Light Whiskey is distilled to very high ABVs(80-94.5%) before entering the barrel and is typically used in blended whiskies. Neutral spirits like vodka are usually distilled to high ABVs  like this as well. High West sourced some 14 year light whiskey to bottle as it was. 

## Review
**Age**: 14 years

**Abv**: 92 proof

**Color**: A light pale gold

**Price**: $99.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Medicinal notes almost like high end vodka with smaller vanilla notes

**Taste**: Also somewhere between a vodka and a bourbon with clear vanilla notes and medicinal notes and a little bit of oak in the background

**Finish**: Long but a little hot especially for something with a 14 year age statement! More sweet and medicinal notes

### On a rock
**Nose**: The ice gets rid of the medicinal notes and the vanilla note is clearer though it is the only note I can pick out

**Taste**: Still medicinal and vanilla notes but the oak is gone

**Finish**: Long and smooth like a nice vodka with a touch of vanilla


## Conclusion
This one was hard to rate given how different it is and since it is my first 'light whiskey' but I was very glad to try it, would probably occasionally order it at a bar as a change up and definitely want to share with other whiskey loving friends. Overall it was great to try it in an unblended state and it's a unique spirit that tastes good if somewhat one note.

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this
