## Wee Beastie

**Age**: 5 years

**Proof**: 94.8

### Neat

**Nose**: Smoked meat and more smoke just to be safe

**Taste**: More smoked meat but with some nice dark fruit and malt notes to balance it. Great mouthfeel for the proof even if it doesn't hold up to a cask strength whiskey there. Excellent proof integration with the smoke and sweet completely covering any burn.

**Finish**: Short to medium finish with more smoke, a bit of wood and some vanila.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies


## Corryvreckan

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 114.2

### Neat

**Nose**: Smoky, peppery meat and rich oak.

**Taste**: Vanilla cream, smoked meat, slightly acrid smoke and rich oak. Great mouthfeel. 

**Finish**: Medium length with a bit of bitterness and plenty of smoky meat.

**0 Stars** - **Poor to Fine:** I would not specifically choose to drink this


## Conclusion

The Wee Beastie does a great job bringing a solid proof, NCF and age statement(albeit a young one) to the sub $50 price point. If you're willing to spend a little more Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength is a step up for sure but in the sub $50 Islay price point Wee Beastie is my go to.

The Corryvreckan is a nice but that slight acrid note is a bummer as is the missing age statement. At this price point I'm expecting a little more to get a star.


**TL;DR:** Great whiskey at an unfortunately low proof and too high a price.
