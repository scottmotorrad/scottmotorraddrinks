**Age**: 10 years

**Proof**: 90

### Neat

**Notes**: Earthy cherry notes dominate the nose. The palate is sweet and earthy with candied cherry, vanilla and rick oak. The mouthfeel is great for the proof and this is an easy sipper. The finish is short to medium length with a bit of vanilla and oak.

**Stars**: **1** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

**TL;DR:** Easy sipper with plenty of flavor, especially cherry
