Today I'm continuing my 1792 series with their cheapest expression and the one that introduced me to the lineup. I was still nice and early in my bourbon journey when I was exploring low cost bottles that were supposed to be better than the bourbon I knew and didn't particularly care for([JD, WT101](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/01/Reviews-8-9-Wild-Turkey-101-and-Jack-Daniel-s-7-on-a-plane/), JB, etc). Spoiler alert, it lived up to that very low hype bar :)

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 93.7 Proof (46.85% ABV)

**Color**: A deep gold

**Price**: 24.99

### Neat
**Nose**: A nice balance of caramel, oak and rye spice notes

**Taste**: Slightly watery mouthfeel with primarily caramel notes and a nit of spice

**Finish**: Short but sweet and caramelly with a hint of spice

### On a rock
**Nose**: The caramel note transforms into something closer to honey and the spice is muted though the oak note holds steady

**Taste**: Still a little watery though the ice helps with the mouthfeel. More honey with smaller notes of oak and rye spice

**Finish**: Still short and sweet with just a touch of spice

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies


## Conclusion
It's a little thin on the mouthfeel and the notes aren't as strong as I like nowadays but it was a great intro in better bourbon and I love the [higher proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/) and [extra aged variants](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/30/Review-35-1792-225th-Anniversary/). If you're early in your journey or looking for a great intro for newcomers I'd highly recommend this great, super affordable bourbon. I also usually have it on hand as a great to share whiskey :)
