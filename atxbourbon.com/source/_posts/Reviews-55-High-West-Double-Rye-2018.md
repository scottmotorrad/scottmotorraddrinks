{% asset_img image.jpg "Double Rye"%}

As my High West series comes to a close (until I score a 2018 MWND :)) we're drinking their workhorse Double Rye! This is batch 2018B28 which I believe is still the 2 year MGP and 16 year Barton blend not the latest 2 year MGP and 7 year High West blend. They changed the blend during 2018 but I couldn't find clear information on the batch numbers and blends.

## Review
**Age**: 2years

**Abv**: 92 proof

**Color**: Amber but a shade on the lighter side

**Price**: $29.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Strong allspice and herbal notes(clove and dill?) with a hint of something sweeter maybe floral honey

**Taste**: Sweeter than the nose with honeysuckle and herbal notes with a slight burn

**Finish**: Medium length finish with predominantly rye and allspice notes

### On a rock
**Nose**: Mostly herbal notes with that MGP signature dill shining through and some sweet honey in the background

**Taste**: A strong clove note with dill and wildflower honey notes then allspice coming in before the finish

**Finish**: Rye spice, allspice and clove notes with a bit of linger but not as much as you would hope

## Conclusion
This is good stuff, especially given the price, it's a bit of safe play but there's nothing wrong with that. This is great go to whiskey and I'm happy to drink it straight or in a cocktail but wouldn't seek it out especially when Rendezvous Rye exists :) 

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
