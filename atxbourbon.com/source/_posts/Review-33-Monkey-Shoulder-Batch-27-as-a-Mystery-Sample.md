Another mystery review! This time from u/kelthfire. I always enjoy these so let's jump right in:

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof (40% ABV)

**Color**: A pale gold 

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and fruity with pear and vanilla

**Taste**: Rich and sweet. The notes are very similar to the nose with more pear and vanilla and the addition of some sherry. A little thin on the mouth feel.

**Finish**: Short and sweet with mostly sherry

### On a rock
**Nose**: Still sweet and fruity though muted with the ice.

**Taste**:  The ice opens this up a bit and helps with the mouth feel. Pears and green apples come to the forefront with the ice

**Finish**: The ice pretty thoroughly quenches the finish.

## Conclusion
### Pre-reveal
Overall this tasted like a middling Speyside scotch, alternatively a scotch style Japanese whiskey. Definitely on lower end of the proof spectrum I'd guess 80-86 proof. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a Glen-something or other aged 12ish years.

**6** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar

### Post-reveal
Ayyy I was pretty close. Monkey's Shoulder batch 27 is a blend of 3 Speyside Single malts, **Glen**fiddich, Balvenie and Kininvie, 80 proof and no age statement but what can you do? The rating lines up with how I use Monkey Shoulder at home, as a cocktail scotch for variations on a whiskey sour.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
