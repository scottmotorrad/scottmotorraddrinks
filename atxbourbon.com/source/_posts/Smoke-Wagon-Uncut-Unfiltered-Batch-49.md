**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 113.8

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is big and bold with brown sugar and rye spice notes. The palate brings caramel sweetness balanced by rich oak and more rye spice. The mouthfeel is excellent and very viscous. The proof is well integrated and is strong enough to let you know it is there without overwhelming. The finish is medium to long with a sticky caramel balanced by that same rye spice.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


## Conclusion

This was a great batch of UCUF and it will be missed. Thankfully Smoke Wagon keeps releasing tasty whiskies.
