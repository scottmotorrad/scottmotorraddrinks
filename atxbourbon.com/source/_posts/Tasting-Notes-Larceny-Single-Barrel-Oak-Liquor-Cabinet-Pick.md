Last July we did a barrel pick on Larceny for Oak Liquor Cabinet here in Austin. In the fall Glazers, a distributor, moved into a new warehouse and all sorts of bottles went MIA. A couple weeks ago these bottles finally landed!

When we did the pick we had 4 samples to choose from and we wanted to pick something accessible with broad appeal. The first sample was surprisingly spicy especially for a wheated bourbon, the 3rd tasted very similar to regular Larceny, the 4th had a unique musty leather note that one picker fell in love with but wasn't the profile we were targeting. We ended up picking the second sample which is described below.

## Larceny Single Barrel Oak Liquor Cabinet Pick
**Age**: 6 years (almost 7)

**Abv**: 92 proof

**Price**: $22

**Barrel**: Rickhouse E Floor 2 Barreled on 3/16/2012

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and simple with butterscotch and grain notes

**Taste**: More butterscotch, cream and wheat notes. Decent mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Medium to short with a touch of sweetness and a bit of wheat grain.

## Conclusion

Overall I am enjoying this as a casual sipper. The sweet and grain notes are simple and pleasant. This is much more a bourbon to sip on during a movie or something and less of something to sit down a really look around for complexity.

On a side note I was an idiot and held onto the little sample bottle to see how it compared to the bottled product. But it was a 1/3 full plastic bottle so when I opened it back up last week it tasted like plastic and regret.

**TL;DR:** Sweet, grain, easy drinking

**No score**: I was one of the main people involved in the pick
