For part 9 of the finished whiskey series we're back to Joseph Magnus with another batch of Cigar Blend. Batch 13 came from the same master blend as batches 11, 12 and 14. Each batch was then finished in a different Armagnac cask. I was lucky enough to get 3 of the batch, 12-14, and it was pretty surprising how much different they were.

## Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Batch 13
**Age**: NAS but all the bourbons are 10+ years

**Abv**: 103.6 proof

**Price**: $170

### Neat
**Nose**: Very rich with leather, brown sugar and baking spice notes.

**Taste**: More leather and more baking spice with tobacco, oak and herbal notes as well as a fainter brown sugar. Thick, viscous mouthfeel

**Finish**: Very long, dry and warm with predominantly baking spice notes though there is a touch of oak and sweetness. 

## Conclusion
I love me some Cigar Blend and batch 13 is no exception. It's significantly spicier than 12 and 14 but not so spicy as to detract from the enjoyment especially if you are pairing it with a cigar. The leather and tobacco notes in these are something I don't usually get anywhere else and they pair really with the brown sugar and herbal notes my favorite MGP bourbons tend to have. I'm a little concerned that between Magnus getting bought out, changing distributors in Texas and the semi debacle of them sourcing at least some of their single barrels from Dickel that the golden age of Cigar Blend is coming to an end. Hopefully not though!

**Update 4/3/20:** [I have been assured by the Magnus Master Blender Nancy Fraley on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B92MjO1n_4t/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) that Cigar Blend has never contained Dickel and that there is nothing to worry about with Cigar Blend as long as she is the Master Blender. That's good enough for me.

**TL;DR:** Not quite batch 12 but still delicious


[**9**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/9/) - a favorite I always try to keep on my shelf

[**Fair**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/fair-value/) - Worth the money, happy with my purchase

I also tasted this as part of a [blind tasting with batch 8, 12, 13 a single barrel and regular Magnus](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B0mG8nInUEd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) though it ended up being somewhat long and rambling. As an added bonus the master blender from Joseph Magnus, Nancy Fraley, decided to show up and shame me in the comments just to be safe.
