I was excited to see GlenDronach release a port aged whiskey that wasn't one of their hard to come by single casks. I really enjoyed this one and it made an excellent base for a penicillin.

## GlenDronach Portwood

**Age**: 92

**Proof**: NAS

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is sweet and easy with honey, pear and dried dark fruit notes. The palate is more of the same with the addition of some holiday spice and a bit of oak. The finish is medium length and slightly dry with dark fruit and holiday spice.

**Stars**: **2** - **Very good whiskey:** I would want to have a bottle


**TL;DR:** Great release that highlights the port.
