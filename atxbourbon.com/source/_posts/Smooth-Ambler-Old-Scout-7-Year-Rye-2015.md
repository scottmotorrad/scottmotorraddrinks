Early in my bourbon journey SAOS went from being a shelfie NDP bottle to very sought after in what seemed like no time. While I was able to grab a 10 year single barrel bourbon at retail before things got too crazy the rye eluded me. I eventually ended up getting one and had high hopes.

## Smooth Ambler Old Scout 7 Year Rye 2015

**Age**: 7 years

**Proof**: 99 proof

**Batch No**: 63 

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and herbaceous with vanilla frosting, dill, mint and spice notes. No proof sting

**Taste**: Spicier than the nose but with the same vanilla and herbal notes behind the rye and baking spices. Good mouthfeel for the proof and great proof integration.

**Finish**: Long and lingering with fading vanilla and oak then herbs and spices that stay in the back of your throat.

## Conclusion

Well that was good but it wasn't some legendary bottle from yesteryear that blows away modern MGP releases. I don't think it's worth tracking down one of these older 7 year, 99 proof SAOS ryes with the increasing availability of 6-8 year MGP ryes from places like Nashville Barrel Company, Proof and Wood, Barrell and Nulu. For example it's taken me a lot longer to get through this bottle than some of the 7 year NBC picks.

**TL;DR:** Good whiskey, especially for the age and proof, not worth the hype

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies
