When I tasted a sample of KC18 a few weeks back I decided I'd grab one if I can across it. Thankfully that day came and now the bottle is almost gone so itâ€™s time for a review.

## Knob Creek 18 Year

**Age**: 18 years

**Proof**: 100 proof

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is rich and sweet with notes of caramel covered nuts, vanilla extract and leather. The palate brings oak, vanilla cream, faint spice and a bit of caramel and leather. The finish is long and surprisingly sweet with lots of caramel and some spice.

**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle


## Conclusion


Overall I think Hardin's Creek Jacob's Well was a little better but the KC18 is still excellent. It's exciting to see Beam release two high age statement hitters this year; hopefully it's the start of a trend for them.

**TL;DR:** The best of the Knob Creeks imo
