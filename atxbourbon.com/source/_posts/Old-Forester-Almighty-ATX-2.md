Late last year a group of us got together to pick another Old Forester Barrel Strength barrel with Debs. Personally I think this is the best one I've helped with yet!

## Old Forester Almighty ATX 2

**Age**: NAS

**Proof**: 130.2

### Neat

**Notes**: Milk chocolate and caramel dominate the nose. The palate reminds me of a room temperature Snickerâ€™s ice cream bar but with a little woodiness to it. The finish is medium length and clean with a burst of caramel and oak.


**Stars**: **3** - **Excellent whiskey:** I would be willing to hunt down a bottle

**TL;DR:** A candy bar in a bottle. My favorite Old Forester pick yet
