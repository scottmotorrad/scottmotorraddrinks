Today we're continuing our journey through the High West line up with a 2017 American Prairie Bourbon. This is a blend of an unknown number of bourbons with 1 from MGP and the rest unknown(at least for the 2017 bottling). 
 
## Review
**Age**: 2-13 years

**Abv**: 92 Proof

**Color**: A deep gold

**Price**: $34.99

### Neat
**Nose**: Very sweet with caramel and vanilla notes and just a touch of burn

**Taste**: Remains sweet with honey and vanilla notes, the mouthfeel is a little thin

**Finish**: The sweetness gives way to a middling length finish with warm spice notes

### On a rock
**Nose**: Slightly subdued but still strong and sweet with the vanilla note taking the lead and no trace of a burn

**Taste**: Rich and sweet with more honey and vanilla and some grain notes coming through. The mouthfeel isn't as improved as I'd hoped but is a little thicker

**Finish**: Short and sweet with more honey notes. The spice from the neat finish is gone.

## Conclusion
Another solid whiskey from High West but this one is a little one note and doesn't have anything particularly exciting going on. I still enjoyed drinking it and would order it at a bar in a pinch but if you are somewhere with High West definitely go with the Bourye or even better the Rendezvous Rye over this guy.
