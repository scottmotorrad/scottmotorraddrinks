Hancock's Reserve is a lower proof offering from Buffalo Trace's fabled mashbill 2. I feel like it's a little bit the odd man out of the line up with people hunting Elmer T Lee, Blanton's and Rock Hill Farms much more than this guy but it doesn't just sit on shelves like Ancient Age.

## Hancock's Reserve
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 88.9 proof

**Price**: $55

### Neat
**Nose**: Sweet and gentle with caramel and vanilla notes.

**Taste**: Smooth and sweet with more caramel and vanilla. Thin mouthfeel.

**Finish**: Short to medium finish with hints of baking spice but mostly sweet vanilla.

## Conclusion

This is simple, sweet and easy to drink. There's nothing bad about it but there's nothing great about it either. I like the sweet caramel and vanilla notes but I'd much rather have one of the other mashbill #2 bottles like Blanton's, Elmer T Lee or Rockhill Farms. I'm glad I got this bottle but I won't be looking for another one.

**TL;DR:** Simple, sweet, smooth

[**Poor**](https://atxbourbon.com/tags/poor-value/) - Overpriced, not worth the money
