## Bardstown Bourbon Company Foursquare Collaboration

**Age**: Blend of 7 and 17 year

**Proof**: 107

### Neat

**Notes**: The nose is sweet, fruity and funky with lots of rye and rum notes. The palate starts sweet and gets spicy with more rye spice and tropical fruit notes plus a bit of vanilla. The long warm finish is slightly bitter but not in a bad way. 

## Conclusion

Overall I really liked this one and the rye and rum were the stars of the show. I didnâ€™t pickup much if any of the classic TN bourbon mineral note which was a pleasant surprise. Thanks again to the folks at Bardstown for the sample!
