## Data
Tasted this at the [Roosevelt Room](https://www.therooseveltroomatx.com/) in downtown Austin at some after dinner drinks this weekend with some family. This seemed like a recent bottling but I am still learning how to discern these things as I continue my BTAC adventure. If anyone knows a great bar to try Saz 18, ER 17 or George T Stagg in Austin let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/atxbourbon/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/scottmotorrad/)!

**Mashbill**: Unknown but it's a wheater

**Abv**: 128.2 proof (64.1% ABV)

**Price**: $32 USD for a ~2oz pour


## Review

**Color**: A deep, reddish color, very appealing the in the low light

### Neat

**Nose**: Mostly sticky toffee with a hint of something stronger

**Taste**: Toffee, caramel and a vibrant fruity taste, dark cherries perhaps?

**Finish**: Smooth and sweet leaving me wanting more

### On a rock

**Nose**: The sweetness is more muted and some of the fruit starts to creep into the nose

**Taste**: Lighter than it was neat but still full of sweet fruitiness and a bit of something like marshmellow added in

**Finish**: Unfortunately muted by the ice. Short and sweet.

## Conclusion 
My second taste of the BTAC was excellent but I preferred [the Handy](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/96ehi3/review_3_thomas_h_handy_sazerac/), especially on ice. Strong but a lot smoother than the proof would lead you to believe. A little too focused on the sweetness for me, I like sweet whiskey but prefer it to have something to spice it up a bit. If you're all or mostly sweettooth you'll love this though. I also let me dad taste it since he was visiting but he said it was too strong for him so we got him a Weller 12 instead. 

8/10 - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Maybe a mixer though I wouldn't want to pay for it

**3 and below** - no thanks
