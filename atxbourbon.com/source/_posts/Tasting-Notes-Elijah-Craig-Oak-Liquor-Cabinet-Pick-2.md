The latest Oak Liquor Cabinet Elijah Craig pick dropped this week. I was part of the group that picked the barrel so I’m a little biased but I think it’s a great pick. No review but here's my notes:

## Elijah Craig Oak Liquor Cabinet Pick #2
**Age**: 10 years

**Abv**: 94 proof

**Price**: $30

**Barrel No**: 5594647

**Rickhouse**: V

**Floor**: 5

### Neat
**Nose**: Oak, nuts and vanilla extract notes.

**Taste**: Vanilla, caramel and nuts with warm spice and leather towards the end. Nice mouthfeel for the proof.

**Finish**: Long slightly dry finish with oak, baking spice and vanilla

## Conclusion

Overall these 10+ year old Elijah Craig picks for $30-35 are a great buy and come pretty close to filling the gap left by McKenna 10 year albeit with 6 fewer proof points. I've got 5 different picks on hand so a blind tasting is definitely needed.

**TL;DR:** A more refined take on Elijah Craig Small Batch with a great finish
