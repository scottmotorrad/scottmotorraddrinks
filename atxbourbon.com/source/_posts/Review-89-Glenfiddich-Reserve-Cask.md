This is the third in a 3 part series comparing some of Glenfiddich's mid range solera vat single malts: the [Select Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/04/Review-83-Glenfiddich-Select-Cask/), the [Reserve Cask](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/12/Review-89-Glenfiddich-Reserve-Cask/) and the [15 year Solera Reserve](https://atxbourbon.com/2019/03/07/Review-86-Glenfiddich-15-Solera-Reserve/). I tasted all 3 of them together but not blindly.

The final entry is the Reserve Cask which is another duty free only bottle that is exclusively aged in sherry casks before being married in the solera vat. I picked this up alongside the Select Cask on the way back from Mexico.

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 80 proof

**Color**: A darker amber 

**Price**: $60

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich dark cherry notes complimented by spice and a bit of oak

**Taste**: Ripe cherry and spice notes with some more oak notes in the background. Solid mouthfeel given the proof but not as nice as the 15 year.

**Finish**: Medium length finish with lingering sweet, dark cherry

## Conclusion
I really enjoyed this deeply sherry influence expression. It had the longest finish of the 3 solera bottles, a nice mouthfeel and rich oak notes with no bitterness. Overall this is solid bottle for the price if you like sherried Speyside single malts and a worthwhile duty free snag even though the 15 year did edge it out by a nose for me.

It was a lot fun to try all 3 of these solera cask single malts side by side and this was a good reminder that most duty free exclusives aren't anything amazing.

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - an all time favorite, must buy/hunt

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
