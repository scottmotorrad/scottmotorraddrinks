After doing a few lower score reviews I needed to drink something I enjoy and have had a few conversations about 1792 lately so 1792 Full Proof it is. 1792 is a range from Bartons and this is their strongest normal bottling(unclear if any of the Full Proof single barrel selects are bottled at a higher proof). This was another great find from [Oak Liquor Cabinet](https://www.instagram.com/oakliquorcabinet/).

## Review
**Age**: NAS

**Abv**: 125 proof (62.5% ABV)

**Color**: A deeper gold

### Neat
**Nose**: Rich a sweet with notes of honey and oak and just a tingle of spice.

**Taste**: A medium consistency with deeper expressions of the notes from the nose. Rich oak, vanilla caramel and hints of spice

**Finish**: The vanilla and oak fade to a lingering spice with just a hint of a burn. Delicious.

### On a rock
**Nose**: All vanilla and caramel, nice but I miss the spice and oak from the neat nose

**Taste**: The oak is back complimenting the caramel and spice. The ice improves the mouth feel for me as well.

**Finish**: Cut a bit short but the same fading sweetness into spice and just the smallest burn.

**1 Star** - **Good whiskey:** I would choose to drink this over readily available whiskies

## Conclusion
I'm a fan of this bourbon but I feel like it needs a little something extra to push it up into the upper star ratings. That said this is shockingly smooth for such a high proof but still has a great mouth feel and strong flavors. So far all 3 1792s I've tried (Small Batch and Single Barrel reviews incoming) have been great and I will be trying to track down more of their line to round out the series.
