This week Oak Liquor Cabinet got in the long awaited series of 1792 picks including a Single Barrel, Bottled in Bond and Full Proof. I've been a fan of the Oak picks in the past and of 1792 in general so I was pretty excited and wanted to get them all in one go. I tasted all of these neat, side by side after ~5 minutes of resting.

## Review
**Age**: All NAS

**Abv**: 98.6, 100, 125 proof

**Color**: A medium amber

### SiB
**Nose**: Sweet caramel and baking spice with a touch of citrus

**Taste**: A little thin with more caramel and citrus notes and a touch of acetone. 

**Finish**: Slightly harsh but decent length with warm spice

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

### BiB
**Nose**:  A less distinct nose with a more generic sweetness probably vanilla and caramel notes

**Taste**: Nice mouthfeel with warm spice, vanilla and caramel. Just a hint of oak

**Finish**: Long and warm with a nice spice balanced with some oak

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

### FP
**Nose**: A rich sweet vanilla caramel with a bit of spice

**Taste**: An amazing mouthfeel with a bold sweet vanilla and baking spice palate with hints of oak and caramel

**Finish**: Long and lingering with warm spice and sweet vanilla and a little burn

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

## Conclusion
It was a lot of fun getting to try all three of these side by side and compare with my old write ups on the [Single Barrel](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/30/Review-22-1792-Single-Barrel/), [Bottled in Bond](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/27/Review-34-1792-Bottled-in-Bond/) and [Full Proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/).

Overall I got a lot of the same notes from these 3 and their regular variants, which doesn't surprise me, but the proportions of those notes, the heat and the mouthfeel are all very different. I personally preferred the BiB which doesn't surprise me since I did this tasting neat. I imagine with a bit of cold water or ice the FP would nudge ahead. The Oak Liquor Cabinet FP is a bit better than the standard, the BiB is a significant step up as is the SiB. I really like the regular FP and BiB but don't particularly care for the regular SiB. This is another great set of picks by Oak Liquor Cabinet.

## Scale
My reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.

**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet

**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf

**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy

**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+

**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection

**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it

**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero

**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch

**2** - no thanks

**1** - pouring out the bottle
